A. MARKET DESCRIPTION:

MAGNUM IS TARGETED AT THOSE IN-HOUSE DATA PROCESSING ORGANIZATIONS WHICH
UTILIZE DEC MAINFRAMES AND MINI COMPUTERS IN A TRANSACTION ORIENTED

ENVIORNMENT. THE FOLLOWING IS BREAK DOWN OF DEC USERS BY INDUSTRY:

INDUSTRY        MAINFRAME GROWTH         MINI GROWTH________        ________________         ___________

MANUFACTURING        40%                       18%

OEM                  20%                       20%

EDUCATION            20%                       27%

GOVERNMENT           15%                       15%

OTHER                 5%                       20%


THE MAINFRAME COMPUTER LINE HAS AN INSTALLED BASE OF ABOUT 1000 UNITS AND PLAN

TO SHIP AROUND 150 UNITS IN 1983. THE MINI COMPUTER LINE HAS AN INSTALLED

BASE OF 6000 AND DEC ESTIMATES THAT 2000 UNITS WILL BE SHIPPED THIS YEAR.


B. 1982 MARKET DATA:

   - MARKET SIZE: $75-100M 

   - NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMER FIRMS: 8,000

   - 1982-86 AVERAGE ANNUAL MARKET GROWTH RATE: 35%

   - MARKET MATURITY LEVEL: GROWTH

   - ONLY 2% OF MINI COMPUTERS HAVE A DBMS INSTALLED AS COMPARED TO MAINFRAMES

     WHERE 50% UTILIZE A DBMS PACKAGE


C. MAJOR MARKET AND ENVIORNMENTAL TRENDS:

    POSITIVE    ________

    - THE DBMS MARKET IS EXPERIENCING VERY GOOD GROWTH

    - RELATIONAL DBMS SOFTWARE HAS THE MARKETS ATTENTION

    - FIRMS ARE EXPERIENCING A RECOVERY FROM THE RESESSION AND ARE BEGINNING

      TO EVALUATE DBMS SOFTWARE AGAIN

    - DP STILL HAS A MULTIY YEAR BACKLOG OF USER APPLICATIONS AND THIS WILL

      GROW AS USERS BECOME MORE AWARE OF WHAT THE COMPUTER CAN DO FOR THEM

    - THE INFORMATION CENTER CONCEPT WILL FUEL THE DEMAND FOR DBMS PRODUCTS

      ON THE MAINFRAME, MINI AND MICRO


  NEGATIVE  ________

    - MARKET ATTRACTIVENESS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION ESPECIALLY

      IN THE IBM MARKET

    - DBMS SOFTWARE PRICES ARE GENERALLY LOWER IN THE DEC MARKET PLACE AS

      OPPOSED TO THE IBM MARKET

    - PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF CUSTOMER

      VISIBILITY

MAJOR OBJECTIVES:

1. TO ESTABLISH MAGNUM AS THE PRIMER DATA DASE MANAGEMENT PRODUCT FOR

   PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS IN THE DEC MARKET PLACE
   
2. TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH VARIOUS MAGNUM DELIVERY METHODS - TIMESHARING,

   IN-HOUSE: MAINFRAME, MINI, MICRO.

3. TO PROVIDE APPLICATIONS PACKAGES WHICH A CUSTOMER COULD PURCHASE AND

   MODIFY TO MEET THEIR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS.

4. OFFER QUALITY CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL PRODUCT CONSULTING.
                

MAJOR THREATS:

1. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO MAGNUM WOULD BE IF TYMSHARE DID NOT

   GIVE THE PRODUCT THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO GET INTO THE

   MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER

2. IN THE TIMESHARING ENVIRONMENT, THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MAGNUM'S 

   SUCCESS IS THE CURRENT TRU PRICING STRUCTURE. PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS

   ARE JUST TOO EXPENSO OPERATE ON OUR SERVICE. ALSO, INSD IN THE PAST

   HAS NOT TARGETED PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS.


OTHER STRATEGIC ISSUES:
