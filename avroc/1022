                           GENERAL PRODUCT NOTES


STRENGTH:

  - HLI - COBOL, FORTRAN, MACRO, BASIC?
  - ACCESS CONTROL DOWN TO FIELD LEVEL (MAGNUM IS DOWN TO RELATION LEVEL)
  - SPSS INTERFACE
  - CONCURRENT UPDATING?
  - INTERACTIVE QUERY FACILITY
  - QUICK RETRIEVAL ON STABLE DATA



WEAKNESS:

  - INVERTED INDEX STRUCTURE (TOUTED AS RELATIONAL LIKE)
  - NO PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE
  - VERY POOR PERFORMANCE DURING ON-LINE UPDATING
  - LIMITED NUMBER OF DATA FIELDS

REFER TO MEMO AND GRAPH CONCERNING TYMSHARE'S EXPERIENCE WITH 1022 AND

  - NO AUTOMATIC JOINING OF RELATIONS IN QUERY-MANUAL
  - QUERY COMMANDS ARE NOT PROTECTED. THAT IS, A USER CAN MARK/FLAG DATA
    FOR DELETION BY ERROR. IT IS THEN UP TO THE DBA TO DETERMINE IF THE
    DATA SHOULD REALLY BE DELETED. MAGNUM CAN RESTRICT THE USER FROM THE
    DELETE COMMAND.
  - 1022 WILL ONLY SUPPORT 256,000 RECORDS PER DATA BASE
