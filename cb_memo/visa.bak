    Dear sirs:

        A month ago, I mailed you a payment of $289.80, check number 1045,
    and included a hand-written letter asking you to close my account. In
    this letter you were instructed to pay off my balance of $1638.64 using
    the enclosed check plus my CardSavings balance of $1348.84.

        You will note that:  $289.80 + 1348.84 = $1638.64.

        A week ago, I received my monthly statement showing that you did
    indeed receive my payment and credit my account for $289.80.  This
    was posted on July 6, 1984 for the period closing July 12, 1984.
    ------

        Not that it should matter, but the reason I am closing my account
    is that First OMNI BANK does not seem to be able to transact business
    without making mistakes on my account.  Not only that, but in trying to
    correct your mistakes, you don't seem to be able to do anything but
    compound and perpetuate them.  You can't even follow simple directions!
    Per my instructions of a month ago, you were to close my account, and
    pay off my VISA/MASTER-CARD balance using the funds in my CardSavings
    account.

        As far as I am concerned, my account is paid in full and closed.  I
    expect you to correct your records and terminate my account as originally
    requested.  If this situation is not resolved to my satisfaction within
    ten working days, then the next letter you receive on this matter will
    be from my attorney.

        Your anticipated cooperation is appreciated.


					Sincerely,



					Carl A Baltrunas
