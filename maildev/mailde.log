Ken,
  I found another {feature} of the RDMAIL program which you
should change.  We already have enough of these ??????.INI
files around, and since we have a routine to read SWITCH.INI,
we ought to use it.  Change the reading of RDMAIL.INI to
use the SW!INI call for ("RDMAIL",null) or "MAIL",null and
let everyone know when it's working to put a line in their
switch.ini of:

RDMAIL	command-list <cr>

SInce both COEES and MAGNUM want to be able to send messages
containing bells (^G), please make a note to let both SEND
and RDMAIL pass ^G's as characters and not as "^" & "G".

ref: MAIL
(as in RDMAIL) needs to allow some kind of beginning and ending
for ranges.  It's ridiculous to have to know what the "last"
message number is.   eg. List 1-20   is fine if you have 20 msgs
If you have 19, you get a "bad range" error.  There doesn't seem
to be a token which means "last" or "end", and I feel that there
should be.   eg. List 12-*   or List 12-end
-Carl.

Bill,

I noticed that (WRS)NBSNAM.SAI and (WRS)NBSSUB.SAI differ substantially
from the copies in (DWS), and (MAILDEV) (the directory I created to hold
the development version of the mail system).  I also note that the source
on (DWS) doesn't build the current versions of (DWS)RDMAIL.SAV or
(DWS)SEND.SAV.  Could the source on (WRS) be preferable to thaton
(MAILDEV) and (DWS)?  Also, do the (SYS) versions of SEND and RDMAIL run
the (DWS) equivalent?

Ken,

That certainly is an improvement to rdmail.  But, as long as it takes
so long to load, and, finding having mail in two locations something of
a confusion, I think I will go back to using the other mail.

Re:   The new Mail System

As mentioned by Bill, the message '[mail waiting]' on login means
that you have mail from the new mail system.  The program to read
new (and old) mail is (DWS)RDMAIL.  It may still have a few bugs
in it.  Type "?" for help, "list new" for a summary of new mail,
"list old" for a summary of old mail, "list all" for ...  etc.

The program to send mail is (DWS)SEND.  It doesn't (yet) allow
command files, but the mail system knows about the "aliases"
OSU, TSU, TYMCOMX, and MANAGERS.  For example, this message was
sent to TYMCOMX.  SEND may still have some bugs in it.

Mail ends up sitting in a file called "[MAIL]".  The funny name
is to prevent people from trying to edit it or type it.  There
will soon be a facility for "filing" messages in other files.

Your comments on the new mail system will be appreciated.

Re:   New Features in RdMail

(Ignore the last message - it uncovered a bug in SEND).

(DWS)RxMail is a field test version of RdMail.  The following are new:

  o  Commands are first taken from RdMail.Ini  (allowing automatic
     'list new' or 'delete before -30').
  o  A few commands now support output files.  I.e. 'list all to foo.log'
     diverts output to foo.log.
  o  RdMail is now smarter about having to write out the mail file.

Caveat: The 'copy' command doesn't work yet.

Re:   (SYS) additions on 930

The following programs exist on SYS on 930 only:
   (SYS)SEND.SAV   runs   (DWS)SEND
   (SYS)RDMAIL.SAV   runs   (DWS)RDMAIL
   (SYS)PEAK.SAV   runs   (DWS)PEAK
No additional access rights are implied.

Re:   Mail system

Dave,
  I found a *BUG* (or feature) which you ought to be aware of
in the new mail system.  If you get the message [Mail Waiting]
and run RDMAIL while you are GFD'd someplace else, it doesn't
do the right thing!

  I did this today and got a new "[MAIL]" file on the GFD'd
directory.  Now, (without retyping the message) there is not
anyway to get that one message consolidated with the rest of
my "[MAIL]" file o--------

Have fun.

Re:   (DWS)SEND and NBS routines

I've made some changes to the NBS stuff on how it handles ALIAS's.  It now
will handle spooling mail to remote sites in a limited way.  See me for
details.  I wrote (DWS)SEND.SAV with a version that is loaded with the new
routines.  The old routines are in (DWS) intact.  New are in (WRS).  We
should talk to make sure its the way we want to leave it.  -Bill

Re:   RDMAIL and GFD'd directories

I understand you now "have" the mail system.  It sure would be nice if
RDMAIL (and friends) always accessed the mailbox file [MAIL] out of
your home directory, rather than your GFD'd one.  I've noticed a [MAIL]
file in (M33) having pieces of mail to and from a large variety of
people, none of which are M33.  -Bill

Re:   Mail system feature

Is there an easy way to delete an unread letter?  I did it the other day
by deleting the appropriate file from MAIL.  However, I'm not sure that
this is safe and it's certainly not your intention that mail be retracted
in this manner.  /Todd

Re:   Rdmail

There is a somewhat friendlier version of Rdmail being run by the
".r rdmail" command these days on :930.  It finds the RDMAIL.INI and
[MAIL] files on the logged-in directory, making it safe to read mail
while you are GFD'd to some other directory.
