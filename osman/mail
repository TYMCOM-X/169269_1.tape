Hi!
  What happenned with Ranier Bank?  (if nothing, then I'll talk to
you about it later....)
  I expect to be in and out, working mostly from home tomorrow, maybe
Thursday too.  Send me mail, or try to call me. If I'm not home, it's
because I'm looking at carpet or talking to the people about my house.

My shedule will depend a lot on how long it takes me to get LIB40 squared
away for COEES.  After that is done, it looks like someone, (me?) will
have to look through the previous transmittals of LIB40, and the sources
that I've found, and basically make sure that we can at least re-build
the LIB40 we have, or as much as is possible.

I'd show it to you, but at this stage, until you transmit something or
see enough "correct" transmittals, looking through "bad" transmittals
for information will only confuse you more...

I was really tired this afternoon, so I slept after I got home until 8:00

Hmmmm.  It sounds like it's still coming along, so I will keep
my fingers out of your broth until we get to talk about the
ingredients again.

I'm still working on the LIB40 transmittal.  CARMEL lets me "replace"
a module with a revision, but there is no way to "extract" a module
an make sure that I have a matching source.  So, my 1/2 hour is turning
into 1/2 hr of code/replacement, but 3-4 days of tracing/rebuilding
the history of LIB40 at Tymshare.   * Sigh *

PS:  I've been logged in, but I was so tired from my morning workout

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The current release of TYMCOM-X, version P034/N has been sent to
    the software distribution department to be installed on all Tymshare
    PDP-10s and customer DEC-2020s.

    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
    affect current operational procedures.  The changes are minor in
    nature and affect functions which are NOT performed on a regular
    basis.  These procedures are as follows:

        A.  Defining (re-building) a structure.
        B.  Changing a system number.
        C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
        D.  Diagnosing system startup errors.


    The attached document, OPER.MEM, contains a detailed explanation of
    the changes and how they may affect current procedures.  A detailed
    list of other changes should be available from software distribution
    as included with the release announcement which they send out with
    each new software release.

    If you have any questions, please send an ONTYME to me at the above
    mailbox address.  Thank you.

Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

             used when the system has been taken down gracefully and

Subject: TRULIM/FORSE sources to match (SYS:26)LIB40.REL

Well,
  After a week of scrounging, with little or no "luck", I found a
source file which generated a binary .REL file the same size as the
one included in LIB40.REL on system 26.  In a stroke of luck, it was
found that although it didn't match, the only difference was the
version number in module FORSE.  I changed the version, re-assembled
it, and VOILA!!!!  FORSE.MAC which generates the proper .REL file!

  A similar comparison shows that no changes were made to TRAPS.REL
(which contains TRULIM) and the ancient source that I found is still
valid.

  One last note:  System 26 has a different LIB40 than that of most
                  of the rest of the world, so I still need to perform
                  a cursory set of tests on system 26 before we give
		  it to COEES for testing.

  Delay!  System 26 has been down from 11pm til 5am for the past two
          days, so the testing will have to wait until this afternoon.


PS:  Jon, feel free to contact Angela and tell her she will have a new
     FTLIB40.REL for COEES to test by tomorrow (Thursday) morning at
     the very latest.  If all goes well in my testing, sooner. I will
     try to call her sometime Wednesday afternoon.

Subject: TRU limit code

I've just completed my testing and installed the new LIB40 on system 26
for COEES to test.  I've sent mail to Angela (rather than a phone call
since it is well after 6pm east-coast time) on system 26 relating the
current status.

Notes on general release of the TRU interrupt code for the rest of the
world....

  1.  F40 - LIB40 on other systems than 26 still need to track down
            proper source files via "trial and error" before a general
            release can be properly made.
  2. P034/P will be the first general release of the monitor to support
            the TRU interrupt, scheduled for October release.
  3. YAMM - Documentation release, also due in October will include TRU
            limit and interrupt descriptions as well as any other changes
            made for P034/P.

  I talked to Angela, everything is straightened out.

  The hotline call yesterday was from Angela.  (She said, about 10am
our time???) I noticed it at 5pm our time and called CUPC opertions and
they didn't know anything about a hotline call.  Odd, because Angela
was working with CUPC operations until 7pm our time trying to back-off
the COEES software...

  C26 /L21 is runing because the system crashed and many of the RPA
appeared to be hung and the system would not load from disk.  So, they
reloaded from tape on /L21.  Angela is going to call them to schedule
a system reload for /N04 later tonight.

  I'm going to work at home and/or run some errands today.  Call me or
send me mail if you need/want anything.

  Also, as far as the monitors for Dallas, we can link together and you
can watch & log what needs to be done.  Let me know when.... /Carl

Subject: Lois's old office

Yes, I guess we need to do something....  I may obscond with Lois's
other lateral file, or so... I've got all that stuff I've moved into
my office to take care of.  Sigh.  Since they're not taking any of
her furniture to Fremont.

There is the other possibility, calling and talking with Jon Mosser
and maybe just moving the stuff downstairs somewhere is possible.  I'd
like to have the stuff nearby... REALLY!  And since we're still here,
I'd like to keep it in the building somewhere. (Even if we have to move
it ourselves... which we can do with the aid of a hand-truck!!!!)


I'll be in around 11ish and we can talk about it..  I've dropped off
the other fiche reader. ...
