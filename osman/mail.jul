Subject: System 24's tape drive is out again

Well, it may be awhile before we get to write the monitor tapes
for Mallinkrondt.  I have both monitors, plus the new /L25 monitor
for system 24 over on 24, ready to test.

However, the tape drive "JUST" died.  I talked to Debbie & she said
they had to call whoever was on stand-by to come and look at it, so
it will be awhile.

More later... Debbie is supposed to call me at home so I can come in
and write the tapes & test the monitors, (all of 15 minutes work)
when the tape drive is fixed and they are finished restoring files
from Mallinkrondt's all-files tapes.  Sigh!

Subject: 56 problems

To Carl, Osman, Bill:
56 started today having numerous jobs in FC state (all but 4 in MAGNUM).
They are running a K monitor, and I know there is a real question whether
jobs ever come out of FC wait in K.  

Anyway, the system was recycled and at first there were numerous "lack of
DDB" problems with cannot init device, cannot open file, fatal MAGNUM errors,
etc.  Only 40 some jobs at the time.  While I was looking at it, the problem
seemed to improve some, and this was not the deteriorating problem that we
used to see with L as repeated tries would result in success.  At the moment
the system seems to be working, but it all leaves me with an uneasy feeling
(at best) as it does Fred Canning.

Ideas?  Comments?  Help?

It was pretty good.  It's an on-going "serial", like a science-fiction
soap-opera, and I only get to see some of the episodes.  They actually
run two different serials simultaneously.  One on weekdays from 7:30 to
8:00 which they show one episode at a time.  With my schedule, I'm not
home usually except on Monday and Friday nights, so I only get to see
parts of it.  The other set of serials is run on Saturday nights only
from 11:15 until sometime between 12:00 or 1:00 am where they show all
of the episodes for a particular story. (Usually they show 4-6 episodes).
Last Saturday, they started a new serial and showed 7 episodes.  I try
to see the one on Saturday night pretty regularly, and have only missed
it once or twice recently.

I realize you just asked how was it tonight, but I got carried away....

Lois,
  I think that it would be a good idea for OSMAN to look at the config
files in OSP and in M33 and look through your systems list to verify
that all the configurations are correct.  This will both aid in getting
the transmittal through, and in making our files "consistant".  I don't
expect this to be very difficult, or need anything much except maybe to
show Osman how to get started doing it.  It will also give him a feel
for what is in the files and what kinds of things are different for each
system.

  Let me know if you both think that this is a reasonable thing to do.

This is a network originated message issued by the base.  The 10 will
sometimes issue a similar message "port capacity exceded".  I have been
about 50% successful at clearing this condition by issuing a "RETAKE" of
the base via PROBE.  You can either do this yourself, or have NETCON do
it.  Looking at the uptime, it appears that they recycled it, which is
about all you can do if RETAKE doesn't work.  I see from (SYS)TAKEIT.LOG
that they used TAKEIT to go down gracefully, which is good, no need to
deposit in 30.

Sunday, every time the directory command was given to TITO, 930 would
crash (gave Bill good practice in reloading 930, anyway).  Tried with
different tapes, different monitors, same result.  There is a note on

Carl, the crash would occur (like a timeout delay) even before the
"TAPE POSITION" prompt.  What is TITO looking for there?  Also, Carl,
when you tried to load L28 you got the READ ERROR OR EOF error.  Really
hard to reload when no one is here to take care of such problems.

The problem was caused by a mis-calculation in a byte-pointer used to
setup the page-map slots in the EPT.

	POINT 18, EPT+<%ONC/1000/2>, -1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>

The formula is correct, but the POINT pseudo-op allows the user to
specify the byte-size and the bit-position in decimal, so instead of
reading

	-1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>
    as
	-1 + ^D 18 * < <%ONC / ^O 1000> & 1 >
 it was read as
	-1 + ^D 18 * < <%ONC / ^D 1000> & 1 >

so, the calculation has been WRONG for a long time, and nobody noticed,
because it just happenned to work with the old values, before I changed
it.

I fixed it, and now it will work, no matter what value %ONC has.  I will

we are running P034/N on 930 right now.  I am assuming that all the
files are up to date on OSP (or wherever they need to be) for .CMD and
the CNFNxx and CONFxx files.  In any case the generated monitors can be
used for testing on each processor type.  The next step is to finish
getting the documentation and command files ready for software distribution
to repeat the compilations and do their part in testing and distributing
the monitor.

Subject: Crash Analysis

The most recent crash analysis done was to trace the problem on system
930 with the tape drive crashing the system every time TITO tried to do
a tape directory.

Symptom:  RUN TITO and do a DIRECTORY ALL command
	  System crashes at EXCMPE+3, exec page failure

Tracing:  (reverse order)
	  EXCMPE: determine if exec & crash if a hard page failure
	  PGFAIL: come here when hardware detects a page fault
		  (trap locations stored in EPT+500-504)
	  OD.RF+11 was where the trap occurred, at interrupt level
		  in module F3TSER.
	  OLDRW1+?? was where the EPT map pages were setup for the
		  tape read transfer, at UUO level in module F3TSER

Problem:  Exec page fault was caused by "not enough" pages setup for
	  the transfer of tape data into the users buffer, or so it
	  seemed.

	  Actual cause was that the EPT map slot entries for the user's
	  data buffer were shifted, so that when the data was BLT'ed
	  from monitor space into user space through the EPT mapping
	  the pages were off by 1.  This was done at interrupt level.

	  At uuo level, when the EPT pointers were setup, a byte ptr
	  was used,  POINT 18,EPT+<%ONC/1000/2>,-1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>
	  which (for all intents and purposes) looks correct.  The
	  problem was that the third operand of the POINT pseudo-op
	  is taken as decimal, thus:  -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^D1000>&1> was the
	  calculation used instead of -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1>.

Solution: Change the formula to -1+18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1> and re-assemble
	  the monitor.

Time frame:  All of this took about a week digging through various
	     modules and comparing F3TSER with MAGSER and FTASER as
	     well as following the code through ONCE startup and using
	     executive DDT to look at the EPT map slots and user buffers.

/Carl

PS:  I, (Carl) did most of the digging, showing Osman, step by step
     as much as I could.  This just happenned to be a very OBSCURE

I certainly hope they are not as long or as disorganized as the one we
attended today.  If I am running the meeting, as I expect to run the
ones we will have here in Cupertino, they shall not be nearly as long
or go off on as many tangents.

I just wanted to let you know that I doubt that Carl is going to be in the 
office today; he felt rather ill when he came home from the meeting last night,
and he doesn't seem to feel much better today. But, I'm sure he'll be in touch
with you as soon as he feels he can sit at the terminal; in the meantime, feel
free to call him at home if you have any problems or questions, Okay? Have a
nice day!...Cherie

THE FOLLOWING WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS. PLEASE POST AND DISTRIBUTE.

TYMSHARE ACQUIRES PRODUCTION CONTROL SERVICES, INC.


     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 9, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc. announced
that it has acquired the major assets of Production Control
Services, Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif.  Terms of the acquisition
were not revealed.

     Production Control Services, with sales of $1.5 million
in 1983, provides repair and support services to the computer
industry.  The company repairs and sells spare parts for a wide
range of disk, tape and memory products made by Ampex, Cal Comp
and other original equipment manufacturers.  At the time of acquisition,
Production Control Services had an inventory of $20 million.

     By merging Production Control Services into Tymshare's
Computer Systems and Support (CSS) division, it is expected that the
combined operation will post sales of about $18 million in 1984,
according to John Swarbrick, vice president of CSS.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field maintenance,
equipment staging and field engineer training for computer equipment
                                                                Page  2

and related peripherals from such companies as Digital Equipment
Corp., Honeywell and IBM.  These services are used by Tymshare
internally and also are available under third party maintenance
agreements for customers throughout the country.

     A new leader in the certification of removable media disk
heads Production Control Services has under development a
portable disk head certification unit for use in the field.
The device will result in significant cost savings to users 
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, 
and by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.
Swarbrick said the new portable unit will be available in the
fourth quarter of this year.

     Tymshare, Inc. offers a broad range of computer services,
and is part of the newly formed Information Systems group of
McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

Hi,
  I'm feeling a little better.  Stomach is still feeling a little
funny, but no more ache at the moment.

  What do you have scheduled for the machines and for DSKCLN.  We
never really got to talk about that.  Is it set for tonight-friday AM
or is it set for tomorrow-saturday AM?  And what have you scheduled?

  I just finally got out of bed, so I'll probably be awake all night
anyway.  So, if it's tonight, I ought to come by later.  What do you
think?  (Of course, If Istart to feel worse again, I'll let you both
know about it via MAIL.)

PS:  Tell John Wilkes that I still have his 44 in the back of my car.
     Somehow, I think that he'd like some kind of terminal for awhile.

	It seems like a good idea, for me to come over at 3.am.  Since
I've not been feeling well, I will leave it open.  If you see me before
3am, then I'll be there and we can go through everything together.  If
no, then just assume that I'm not feeling well again.  I want to get this
monitor distributed, so I will try to work on the documentation and stuff
so it can be sent to software distribution.

   See you tonight, probably.    PS:  If you're at the office, go home!
					you hav to get some sleep, you know!

I expect that no more than an hour, unless there are other things
to discuss.

Conference room J is the room by the VG-2B message center opposite

Subject: New Peak

    Yes, it's true!  The latest version of Peak, though lacking the
    incredible WARPLD fast-start feature, does have timer-generated
    checkpointing, and therefore spends the bulk of its time in TI
    (rather than SL) state.  This should result in a greater rapport
    with the Tymcom-X scheduler, making the Peak experience a bit
    friskier in loaded situations.

    Let me know if you notice any problems arising from this giant
    leap in Technology.  Use SENDMA.

Subject: TRU interrupt code

It's all written, and tested to my satisfaction.  It can be set by
the console command "SET LIMIT n" or by the SETLIM UUO (CALLI -150).
The interrupt fires properly, and the user can continue to process
normally until a RESET or EXIT occurs.  When the interrupt fires, the
programmable limit gets set to 0, while the frame limit stays the same.

I'm pretty sure that it is checked every tick, which may be a performance
problem.  If it turns out to slow down the system, then I will have to
move the code to the once-a-second or once-a-minute routines.  I cannot
tell until it gets tested by COEES.  If the code must be moved, it will
take all of 1-half hour to change it and re-telecopy a newer version to
system 26.

Subject: Yes, lots of work...

I was working all day yesterday, from 2PM to11PM, and from 1AM to 6:30AM
and again this afternoon and tonight trying to make sure everything was
working.  I had most of it working, 'cept for a couple of snags as of
last night.  I dug through things and fixed the snags tonight, and the
new monitor for 26 just finished being telecopied over to 26.  Now, I
must call operations and make sure it gets reloaded tonight.  (I talked
to debbie last night to schedule the reload, so shouldn't be a problem
since no-one is on 26 right now.)  **WHEW** now I can relax a couple of
minutes...

I'm probably going to take off from work on tuesday,wednesday or thursday
for most of 2 days to get my weekend... I'm just letting you know ahead of
time... talk to you more tomorrow afternoon.  /Carl

        The Network Systems Staging Unit (NSSU) is being challenged with:    
increasing numbers of networks, larger custom networks, and networks  
with more custom development. The growth in NSSU's responsibilities   
could translate to your professional growth. 
     
     
        The Senior Network Consultant will provide technical leadership,
and coordination with Field and Headquarters organizations in the
system integration and performance certification of custom networks. You   
will be involved with the configuration and generation of new networks.    
You will be one of the first persons to apply new TYMNET technology   
to products purchased by our customers. 
     
     
        These are exciting positions which require a solid academic and 
applied experience in TYMNET operating systems and applications. You  
need to be a self starter and able to follow through on difficult tasks.   
Previous management experience will be beneficial.
     
     
        This position announcement is distributed for your information. 
You are reminded to confer with your immediate supervisor regarding   
your interest in contacting me for consideration. Your immediate 
supervisor will assist you in assessing your career path within your  
current organization.
