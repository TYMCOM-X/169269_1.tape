SCNSER: Fixed GOTBUF routine to not mangle PDL in the case where
there is contention for block I/O input buffers. /Darren 08-Jan-81

CLUBS: FIXED BUG IN CLBINI UUO THAT CAUSED IT TO RETURN THE ID
OF THE CURRENT JOB RATHER THAN THAT OF THE JOB HOLDING THE
LOCK.  /TODD 1-13-81

LPTSER:	UUO to reload LP20 VFU now error returns if LP is off-line.
/GL 1-21-81

SCHED1: Moved TI queue higher in swap out priority, just below
SL. Reason for this is alleged problem reported in Paris
concerning ML waiters getting swapped out when TI jobs were still
hanging around in core, causing PCB resource turnaround to go
way down. Observed this on C29 (Coees). Moved TI to be swapped out
before any sharable resource wait, since sharable resource
waits should normally not be long. This may not be exactly right
because of other low priority reasons for going into ML wait
(Aux circuit wait, block I/O stuff, etc). /EVS 1-22-81

F3TSER: Fixed bug that caused random location to get clobbered
in MAGINI (GETST smashes T2, but MAGINI uses T2 as AOBJN pointer.)
/EVS 1-28-81

SCNSER:	Added IRPMSG to hold 1st word of input message currently being
processed.
COMMON:	Corrected address of KMC control register 0 to 760540 from
760541 in the crash code to reset the KMC's RUN bit. /GL 1-30-81

ONCDSK: Added R,RE,REF,REFR,REFRE commands to say type REFRESH.
Changed ARE YOU SURE to Say that it deletes all files to do a refresh
and if they really wanted to do it. /CAB 2-2-81

SEGCON: fixed LOGOFF uuo to not allow starting LOGOUT at ***ANY***
address.  /WRS 03-Feb-81

COMMON: fixed SBDIAG instructions (@ERASTS) to select controller
#4 (DMA20), and perhaps retrieve useful information. /Darren 06-Feb-81

SCNSER: Also saving start of last 3 IRING messages in IRPMSG, IRPMS2, 
and IRPMS3 to catch KMC bug.  /GL 07-Feb-81

PICON: (KL only) Do SBDIAG and RDERA on every APR interrupt.
	***NOTE*** This information is stored in PICON:SAVERA and
	PICON:SAVSB0+1. Disable Sbus errors when disabling MemBusParity
	errors. Type out APR status, ERA, and SBUS function 0 on
	every parity error before sweeping core. /Darren 10-Feb-81

COMMON: Put JBTWRS (job state trace) table back in.
CLOCK1: Restore calls to WRSMAP routine.
SCHED1: Restore WRSMAP routine and calls to it, minus 2K MAPQUE
	table; check in PAGWAK for job going into SS from state
	other than SW. /Darren 10-Feb-81

FRMSER: Fixed confusion in FRJSLO (gate jumps) about what was in P4 -
SLIGOS was getting "bad frame number" error returns because
frame handle address was in P4 instead of frame handle index number.
Cure is to refetch index out of user AC. /EVS 2-13-81

SCNSER:	Doubled high character limit for 2020s form ^D1000 to ^D2000 to
compliment the KMC bug fix.  /GLYONS 2-27-81


P034/J
------

FILUUO: changed code in close (CLSN2B) to not force access date
to be updated when ATPALC is being cleared unless the file was
actually accessed (ie. INPB or MAPB are on).  Note: ATPALC will
still not get cleared if CLSACC is set in the close (inhibit
access date).
/WRS 3-17-81

SWAMP: Call SLOCLE when the first bad sat is discovered so that a slow
DSKCLN is rquested by monitor.  /Todd 3-17-81

FILUUO: New entry point SLOCLE can be called to force full DSKCLN.  Same
as SLOCLN except is called with a pushj and returns to next instruction.
FILIO: Changed SLOCLN call to SLOCLE.
SWAMP: Added code to cause a full DSKCLN if an output error on a SAT
is detected.  /Todd 3-19-81

FRMSER: FRMOP function to read effective rights always returned zero
for created process handles.  This is because check for PNO of created
process handle was made against JBTSPN instead of JBTPNO.  Fixed this.
(Found by SLIGOS).  /SOCCI 3-20-81

F3TSER: Fixed bug in error detection code at end of reads ad OD.RF.
Added new error bit TIMOUT that Poole told me about. /SOCCI 3-20-81

UUOCON: fixed bug in DATUUO for converting from 1 word format.
/WRS 3-20-81

UUOCON: made SIMINS flag a suppressed symbol.  /WRS 3-20-81


P034/K
------

FILUUO: Dskclr mode 0 now sets Adjmws to -1.  /Todd 5-1-81

F3TSER: Discovered that new OVRRUN bit (overrun of tape channel)
comes up when reading record longer than channel word count.
Changed OD.WF status checking code to allow this to happen.
(not good that can't detect combination overrun and length error).
/EVS 5-1-81

F3TSER: Discovered that EOF bit is really EOT indicator on writes.
Indicates reading a file mark on reads. The real EOT bit in tape status
only says tape is at exactly EOT. Changed forward and back record,
write gap and write tape mark, read and write interrupt routines to
reflect this. Now, IOTEND will only come on on writes, IODEND will
only come on on reads. Program is responsible for detecting two EOF marks
as logical EOT on reads. I don't know if this is compatible with our other
tape services. /EVS 5-8-81.

F3TSER: Make OD.SKR and OD.BSR always clear IOLEND and IOTEND after J04
change took that behavior away.  Set TUBSB in tape UDB on hung tape 
transfers.  /EVS 5-8-81.

COMCON: Modify WSCTL CALLI to not change JBTSTS<JWSADJ> on read-type
functions.
/DARREN 5-13-81

SCNSER: Fix for the "Messy Screen" KS Block I/O bug. at GOBIO2+13,14,15.
/GLYONS 5-13-81

COMMON: Fix for the primitive RM/RP drivers to wait a few ms before
testing to see if write done so as not to saturate the unibus. 
/Todd 5-14-81

APXKON:  Fixed bug in disk driver which forgot to turn off disk
conroller "idle" flag after a transfer - caused lost tape interrupts,
since tape would interrupt and disk control idle flag would still be
on.  (Foonly interrupts aren't like interrupts on the other machines,
where as long as the interrupt flag is on the interrupt will keep
coming in.  You only get one interrupt when the flag is set by the
microcode (microcode keeps a count for every channel of how many
flags were set for each channel)).  /EVS 5-26-81

COMMON:	Slight change to KS primitive disk code that TODD fixed to handle
4 or more disk drives on the KS.  Wouldn't complile because macro doesn't
like "100." as a notation for 100 decimal.  Changed 100. and 2000. to 
^D100 and ^D2000 (near symbol RMP1:).  /GLYONS 6-8-81

SCNSER: Moved command request and forced command bits from the left
  half of LDBDDB to the left   half of TTYTAB.
- Remove the spare LDB and all of its associated merde.
- Overhaul the ZAP/HANG code to reflect the aforementioned.
- Remove TTYCOM, COMWCM, SETKIL, and TTFCOM.
- Modify LOGIN/TTYINI/INISET to assign frame number before forcing
  command.
- Don't allow aux circuits to log into a shut system.
COMCON: Moved forced command/command request bits into left half of
  TTYTAB.
- Overhaul command dispatcher, assuming job number is always assigned.
- Add the following routines:
  * CHKKIL - called at end of command dispatch to see if job needs
    to be killed (copied/modified from SCNSER:SETKIL).
  * COMKJB - kill a detached job/frame.
  * COMWCM - Set command request &/or forced command for a frame
    (copied/modified from SCNSER:COMWCM).
  * COMCMR - Command finish-up (copied/modified from SCNSER:TTYCMR)
  * TTFCOM table - copied from SCNSER.
  * FRMCOM - Find a frame with command pending (copied/modified
    from SCNSER:TTYCOM).
FRMSER: Extract FRMASN (Assign Frame Number) routine from CREFRM
  and make it callable from LOGIN in SCNSER.
UUOCON: Changed RLSLDB UUO to CPOPJ.
COMMON: Define COMFLG bit table in jobs rather than ports.
- Change LINNTB to BITNTB and redefine for general use.
- Remove now-extraneous PVZHNG byte pointer.
- Delete now-unused LINTBE definition.
CLOCK1: Move TIMSET and TIMRST argument words here from SCNSER and
  add CLKJOB byte pointer for writing job # into them.
PICON: Use CLKJOB instead of hard-coded byte pointer.
/DARREN 6-9-81

COMMON - Remove symbol SETWCH, no longer used.
CLOCK1 - Clear JBTWCH in CLRJBT, prevents job from getting previous job's
  WATCH setting.
/DARREN 6-10-81

PICON - Make APR console messages more precise and more verbose for maint.
engineers who turn out to need almost as much hand-holding as operators.
/DARREN 6-10-81

ONCE:	Added a warning message when bringing up a 2020 manually to the
effect that "the KMC will not be loaded so the Host will NEVER synch. with
the Base".  Also made the CONSOLE command available to non 2020 monitors.
/GLYONS 6-19-81

COMCON - Fix problem where jobs would get hung with command pending
because COMCNT was zero, caused by cases where job would exit
from command dispatcher with different job number than that
with which they entered (e.g., ATTACH).  /DARREN 6-22-81

SCNSER: Input and skip auxcals will no longer go into wait when there are
echo chars, but no input chars and no chars can be converted (because of
backpressure, etc.).  Also, if a job becomes detached after an inc and
skip auxcal has begun execution, the auxcal will error return.  /TODD 6-29-81

SCNSER: Execute echo logic even for a backpressured port.  Don't allow
output if it is attempted.  This allows echo characters to be converted
into input characters when a port is backpressured and echoing is turned
off (as for an aux circuit).  /TOD-81

SCNSER: Fix code to allow echo when backpressure on.  /TODD 7-7-81

SCNSER: Allow backpressure off to be output on a backpressured port.
Change definition of BPOKBN to fix off-by-one error.  /TODD 7-7-81

SCNSER: Clear SKPFLG befor ABTUUO is called in TWAITC.  /TODD 7-8-81

SCNSER: Process only data present in input ring at start of processing
before servicing the output ring.  This should solve the problem of character
lossage that results from reading too much data for one port before 
backpressure can be applied.   /TODD 7-14-81

IOCSS - Add BFICLN fix which forces "previous context user" before trying to
clear user's input buffers, thus preventing STKAC crashes.
/DARREN 7-23-81

SCHED1 - Change AOS BADSS to STOPCD at PAGWK1+2 in yet another further
attempt to track down JBTPGO loop bug.
/DARREN 7-23-81

UUOCON - Always allow (SYS) programs to write to the CTY.
Logoff programs that SETNAM to EUTHAN (giggle).
/DARREN 7-24-81

FILRIB - Add hack at RIBEX2 to insure correct value for RIBSZS before trying
to expand RIB (to be removed when problem has been diagnosed more thoroughly).
Also count number of times each of the RIB expansion routines is called.
/DARREN 7-24-81

SCNSER: Added routine BPTEST to test to see whether few enough chars remain
to be read such that backpressure can be turned off on a port.  Call this
routine where necessary.  Previously backpressure was turned off too often
causing the number of unread input chars for a port to progressively increase
until chars were thrown away.  Changed TIHLTN to be max number of chars in
input ring for one port so that backpressure on has a chance to be put in the
output ring.  Fixed code at TTYSTR to consider both def and remote echo
break chars.  /Todd 7-24-81

RMXKON: inserted fix for RMX ECC bug that was patched on 654 and
seems to work.  Simply forces page transfer when doing retries
since block transfers seem to not work very well.  /WRS 7-27-81

COMMON - Redefine SCNN (# TTY DDBs) to JOBN+PORTN+1 from 
MAX(JOBN,PORTN)+AXDDBS.  Incidentally, symbol AXDDBS is now
extraneous (i.e., never referenced anywhere).
/DARREN 7-29-81

Added 2 new entries to CONFIG table in COMMON:
    PATMAP= CONFIG+42/ bit n is on if patch n is installed
    MONID= CONFIG+43/ sixbit serial number of monitor in form M#####
	changed for every monitor to prevent confusion when config
	changes or such.
/WRS 8-13-81

RMXKON - Correct RMXADD to give error return only when actually 
attempting to read past end of cylinder (previously gave error even 
when reading up to the end). /DARREN 8-14-81

RMXKON - Check for zero offset before backing up to previous block, thus
preventing exec page faults in ECC correction routine DATERR. (Ernie's 
fix)  /DARREN 8-16-81

COMCON: Remove check for non-zero job number upon return from command
dispatch, since we no longer depend on it for updating the tables.  This
fix will prevent further crashes at COMDIS+5. /Darren
/DARREN 8-17-81

CIOPR: fixed bug which left interrupts enabled after a nodeload. /ERNSTD   
/TODD 8-24-81

IOCSS: Set the "previous context user" bit to user before doing a buffered
mode close and restore to previous previous context user when done.  This
is necessary so that the monitor can do a close on chan 0.  /TODD 8-24-81

COMCON - Put COMDIS+5 crash check back in - will fix individual commands
instead.  /DARREN 8-25-81

FILUUO - Fix DSKCOM command to always restore J before exit.
/DARREN 8-25-81

CORE1: fixed code in DOXCT routine which handles UXCT## macros to not
reference 1(P) so that interrupts might be less devestating.  /WRS 8-27-81

F3TSER: Changed OLDMOP to use exec virtual locations starting at %ONC instead
of page 500.  This is necessary because page 500 (and above) may be used for
other things in a big enough monitor.  Hopefully the use of %onc to %onc + ?
is not in conflict with anything else.  There is currently no good way to
know precisely which exec virtual pages are "claimed".   /TODD 8-31-81

COMMON: FILUUO: changed crash code to pickup PCs from STOPCD(SLO) and 
STOPCD(NO) in a more structured and accurate manner.  Also STOPPC will now
only get decremented when it contains a real PC so DEP in 30 will not
show up as STOPPC/-1 anymore.   /WRS 9-1-81

FILRIB: Remove RIBEX2 hack, add better checks in RIBCK1 for consistency
between RIBSZS and RIBSNM, and fix DLTSRB to adjust RIBSZS when RIBSNM 
has been decremented to zero.  /DARREN 9-2-81

COMMON: Do a TNCONO for F3s when sys comes down to tell the node that
the sys is down.  This allows the node to resync with the host much faster
because the node waits about 1 min. after it first learns that the host is down
before resynching.  /TODD 9-2-81

CORE1: Make sure VALID and REMOVE set up J before calling PAGWAT.  This
should prevent any more JBTPGO loops, but it's hard to say since the
problem couldn't be duplicated reliably.  /DARREN 9-9-81

COMCON: Fix TIME command to restore job # after an attempt to get time
on another job without appropriate lic.  Caused COMDIS+5 crash when TIM 0
tried.   /TODD 9-10-81

COMMON: Created the crash data block (CRSDB) where all important crash
data is storred in an orderly defined manner so programs like CRSHID can
get at them without symbols or other kludge.  /WRS 9-11-81

ONCE: Changed the SCAN and SCNTB macros to allow for a more versatle
set of commands and options, and to ignore the UNI and STR fields needed
in the corresponding macros in ONCDSK.  Modified the CMDSCN routine from
the ONCDSK module to work with the new macros and made it local to ONCE.

ONCE: Added the FULL command for bringing up the monitor to run a FULL
DSKCLN for this time only.  Nothing is written in the HOM pages.
/CARL 10-9-81

Scnser: Tihltn <- 2 * size input ring (in chars) + Tiwrnn.  This should
reduce character losage for bases that don't know when to quit sending
us characters on one port.   /TODD 10-13-81

Note: Lospdp does NOT necessarily mean that we're too slow in requesting
backpressure.  Consider:  host receives .ge. tiwrnn chars so requests
and sends bp on, next time thru i ring lopbpn gets set again because
# chars is .gt. tiwrnn and .lt. tihltn, enough chars are present in
ring so that further reading of chars causes tihltn to be exceeded.  This
may (should) be changed.   /TODD 10-13-81

ONCE: Again modified SCAN and SCNTB macros.  Moved CMDSCN routine back
into ONCDSK.  Changed FULL command to be highest priority even to
override DSKCLN xxxxxx set by FILES.
Made FILES command harder to enter by asking for verification to
enter the ONCDSK dialogue.
ONCDSK: Modified SCAN and SCNTB macros as per ONCE.  Added some better
documentation in the HELP messages for the commands.  Added a bit
to the SCNTB macros to require verifiation of individual commands.
Removed earlier edit for REFRESH command and cleaned up some of
the associated code.  /CARL 10-15-81

S:  Bumped counter OND in MAPONC macro from 6 to 7 because ONCDSK
grew some.  /CARL 10-15-81

Scnser: Make Auxcal function 10 behave like Skpinc for command port.
Previously would assume chars were present if a command was waiting
to be rescaned.   /TODD 10-16-81

Scnser: Don't wake job if backpressured port that is not in input wait
attempts to echo a character.  /TODD 10-21-81

ONCE: Fix problem with SCNTB macro under IFKMC < ... > conditional.
It seems that IFKMC translates to "REPEAT 1," and an extra set of
angle brackets "REPEAT 1,<< ... >> causes MACRO-10 to break generating
correct code, but producing assembly error messages.  Changed SCNTB
macro to omit the duplicate "<>"'s allowing a clean assembly.
/CARL 10-28-81

Common: Fix bug that caused free core Aobjn pointer to have its length
set too large if the size of the free core bit table is greater than
^D144 words.   /TODD 11-3-81

Core1:  Location Maxcor contains the beginning of free core relative
address of the highest free core block assigned.  Accessable via
Getlnk gettab.   /TODD 11-6-81

F3tser: Fixed Oldmop to work with odd %onc.   /TODD 11-6-81

F3tser: Setup Oldmop buffer byte pointer correctly.  /TODD 11-12-81

F3tser, Magser: Fix buffered mode tape op to work when buffer empty.  
Two problems were present: (1) SRFX didn't return properly for empty 
buffer. (2) MT resource was not released when buffer was empty.  
/TODD 11-13-81

COMCON: Modified DAYTIM command code to display the time zone immediately
after the date and time display.  Currently "unknown" time zones have the
letter designation as copied from the YAMM.  For daylight-savings time,
the associated codes have a plus-sign "+" after the letter.

COMCON: Moved routine PRTIME out of the daytime command and made it
callable to return "hh:mm:ss" on the current output device.  Routine
PRTIM has been changed print 2 digits each for SS.HH although it may
leave out HH:MM:.... if both are zero.  Will also print 2 digits for
minutes.  (uses common code from PRTIME).

UUOCON: Made routine DSTCHK internal so that the daytime command can
check to see if the current time/date is between periods of daylight-
savings, as per the table in uuocon.  /CARL 11-18-81

COMCON: Changed WATCH-DAY routine to use PRTIME instead of PRTIM.  We
don't want to see hh:mm:ss.hh for time of day.  However, we are leaving
out the time zones from this command.  Also, fixed code which printed
out a clobberred register as the hundredths of seconds.  Now works ok.
/CARL 11-18-81

IOCSS: Get UPT and UPX locks in cannonical order (lowest frame number
first) in VREPLU to avoid deadlock.  /TODD 11-18-81

Frmser: Install Sligos fix to Chepar.  Previously right of parent
instead of child was being checked.  /TODD 11-20-81
