DUMPER on TOPS-20 is the equivalent of TITO on TYMCOM-X. They are utility
programs to save files on magnetic tapes from disk, and later to restore
them to disk.


DUMPER and TITO features:   

     1)  incremental and weekly save
     2)  file restoration
     3)  wild cards for file specification
     4)  minimum characters needed to be typed for commands


DUMPER features which TITO lacks:    

     1)  archive and migrate files
     2)  can make tapes in interchange mode, which can be read by the
         TOPS-10 BACKUP program
     3)  user can give save set names for each set of tapes being
         saved
     4)  more file date selection options, for example, select files
         whose last system write date is before the date and time
         specified. The last system write date is the most recent
         time the file was physically changed on disk. This change
         includes copying the file.
     5)  user can specify how many logical records per physical
         record written on tape
     6)  can interrupt an operation


TITO features which DUMPER lacks:    

     1)  can use indirect files as file specification
     2)  tape directory includes tape positions for each file on
         tape, faster file restoration
     3)  user can specify the logical beginning and end of tape
     4)  prompts user whether to continue saving files when
         encountering tape write errors

access of TITO and DUMPER    

     TITO can be run by typing "r TITO" at the monitor level in Tymcom-X,
     DUMPER by typing "DUMPER" at the monitor level in TOPS-20.  A
     privileged user on TOPS-20 is a user with operator or wheel
     capability.  With privileges enabled, he/she can run DUMPER to backup
     all user files; a non-privileged user can only save/restore files
     he/she has access to.  Write file and get device license need to be
     set before running TITO. If the user wants to save all system files,
     systat and operator license also needed to be set before running
     TITO.


flavors of commands  

     TITO's most common commands (STORE, RESTORE, GET and DIRECTORY) are
     composed of three parts: verb, object and modifier to the objects;
     the "modifier" equivalent in DUMPER are

          1)  either commands by themselves which have to be input before
              the verb.  For example, "*store all created after 10:10 10
              OCT 82" in TITO is equivalent to in DUMPER:

                   DUMPER> since 10-OCT-82 10:10
                   DUMPER> save *.*

          2)  or there are switches which act just like TITO's modifiers.

     The objects and modifiers acceptable by TITO are on page 16-17 of
     TITO USER'S GUIDE. The switches acceptable by DUMPER are in section
     7.6 of TOPS-20 USER UTILITY GUIDE.


Incremental and full-dump  

     incremental refers to saving changed files. Doing a full-dump on TITO
     is referred to as "all-file". Doing a full-dump on DUMPER is referred



                                    2
Analysis of DUMPER and TITO                               October 28, 1982


     to as "full-dump". Full-dump saves all system files.  DUMPER's
     incremental dump saves files which are modified since the previous
     full-dump or incremental dump. TITO's incremental dump saves files
     which are modified since the previous incremental dump.  In other
     words, incremental dump is treated as part of full-dump by DUMPER but
     not by TITO, so after a full-dump, there are generally more files to
     be dumped using TITO than DUMPER.


general command comparison  

     DUMPER and TITO commands will be classified into

          1)  action commands, which start, stop, interrupt or continue a
              file operation
          2)  status-setting commands, which set up the parameters for
              action command
          3)  tape-positioning commands, which positions the tape
          4)  information commands, which type out information

further comments 

     1)  TITO has very limited documentation. for example, TITO USER'S
         GUIDE listed error messages printed out by TITO but without any
         suggestions about what user should do with these errors.

     2)  TOPS-20 has the concept of "structure", so user should specify
         structure names as part of command if the particular structures
         needed to be saved/restored.

     3)  An operator often needs to run DUMPER along with other programs
         (like OPR); this can be done with commands PUSH and POP. The
         tricky part is that operator is just like any other user when
         running DUMPER, so even though he/she is in charge of all the
         mount tape requests on the system, he/she still has to submit a
         mount tape request on the monitor level, then get into OPR to
         answer his/her own request, then get out of OPR to continue
         DUMPER operation. If the operator does not use the /NOWAIT switch
         in the command MOUNT TAPE, then he/she would hopelessly sit in an
         infinite loop until sundown. In such case, the operator should
         control-C out of the infinite wait, use the command CANCEL to
         cancel the previous mount request and submit another mount tape
         request with the /NOWAIT switch. Also note that READ-ONLY is the
         default mode for MOUNT TAPE command, users have to specify the
         /WRITE-ENABLED switch if he/she wants to write from disk to tape.

                 SECTION II - ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC ITEMS                       




file license 

     DUMPER - no file license on TOPS-20.

     TITO   - operator, write files, systat and get devices license should
              be set before running TITO to do incremental or full dump.
              However, during file restoration, if the file on tape has a
              certain license set which user doesn't set before running
              TITO, then TITO will restore the file but not restore the
              license. It kindly prints out the message "file (filename)
              not given license (licensename)". User can then restore the
              license later.


logging

     Both DUMPER and TITO have the capability of logging individual files,
     or restricting the log to directories, or suppressing the log except
     for the totals. In DUMPER the commands are FILES and NO DIRECTORIES,
     in TITO the commands are MODE FILES and MODE TOTALS.  The nice
     feature of DUMPER error messages is that the warning messages are
     prefixed with a question-mark and fatal messages with a percent-sign.
     DUMPER allows the user to specify the name to be written in the
     saveset header on the tape by the command "SSNAME", and this name
     also appears on the terminal as a header for each tape saved or
     restored.  There is no way to give a save set name in TITO, so on the
     terminal, it prints out something like "TAPE NUMBER 1 FOR 12:12 10-
     OCT-82".


restart capability 

     In case of a system crash during a save or restore process, the user
     of DUMPER and TITO can restart by picking up where he/she left off.
     In DUMPER the command is "INITIAL (filename)". In TITO use the
     modifier "STARTING WITH (filename)" to the appropriate command,
     filename being the last file saved or restored before system crash.


user aborts 

     DUMPER - control C aborts DUMPER.  To halt the current command, type
              control E. DUMPER will interrupt the current command. User
              can then type any status-setting command followed by the
              "CONTINUE" command to continue the interrupted operation. If



                                    7
Analysis of DUMPER and TITO                               October 28, 1982


              the user types any other command, DUMPER will ask: " do you
              really want to abort your interrupted command?" Answering
              "YES" aborts the command.

     TITO   - not very user-friendly. Control C at the prompt "*" level
              aborts TITO. When TITO is in the middle of an operation,
              type two control Z then one control C.  When TITO is waiting
              for a new tape to be mounted, typing "NO" for the prompt
              "mount next tape:" will abort TITO.


use DUMPER to migrate/archive   

     DUMPER has the feature of migrating files or saving files from an
     archive area which TITO lacks. Migration is involuntary file transfer
     from disk to tape while archival is voluntary. Archiving files are
     done at the user's request.  Migrating files are not done at the
     user's request. Migration is a means of clearing disk space of files
     that have not been referenced within a specified period of time. To
     migrate files, operator runs REAPER program and specifies a period of
     time, so that files not touched within such period are marked for
     migration. To archive files, the user types the "ARCHIVE" command at
     EXEC level to have their files marked for archival. DUMPER then can
     be run with the switch "/ARCHIVE" or "/MIGRATE". This is a 2-pass
     process to provide a backup system in case one tape is bad or
     misplaced. Files then are deleted from disk; unless the user has
     specified the subcommand "RETAIN" in the "ARCHIVE" command to have
     the contents of files be retained.  Users can issue the TOPS-20
     command "RETRIEVE" to retrieve archived or migrated files, this
     creates an entry in the system retrieval queue which can be displayed
     by typing the command "INFORMATION RETRIEVAL-REQUESTS". Then DUMPER
     can be run with the command "RETRIEVE". Be sure that the retrieval-
     requests queue is NOT empty, otherwise DUMPER waits indefinitely.


tape error recovery  

     for both DUMPER and TITO, there is very little to do for tape error
     recovery. They both print out a warning message when encountering a
     bad spot on tape during file restoration and dump.  Tape error
     recovery is possible during file dump but not during file
     restoration.  During the file dump, user can recover the file
     manually by mounting a new tape and restart saving the same file.
     TITO is nicer than DUMPER in the way that TITO asks the user if the
     operation should be aborted while DUMPER only prints out warning
     message.

     DUMPER - when DUMPER encounters bad spots on tape where data can not
              be written or read, it writes a duplicate record immediately
              following the invalid record, and prints the message "write
              error on tape, record [n], writing duplicate record".

     TITO   - when TITO encounters write error on tape, it asks the user



                                    8
Analysis of DUMPER and TITO                               October 28, 1982


              whether to continue the job. If user answers yes then the
              end of file mark will be written and TITO will store the
              file on tape again. If user answers no then TITO writes an
              end of file mark and returns to command level.


can DUMPER handle a very large file?      

     yes, the size of any single file is limited only by TOPS-20 file-
     length restriction. If a file goes over one tape during DUMPER
     operation, DUMPER simply prompts user to mount another tape.


tape block size  

     blocking refers to writing physical records on tape which contain
     more than one logical record. Blocking saves tapes and time, since
     the number of gaps between records on tape are reduced.

     DUMPER - user can set blocking factor using the command "set block
              number". The number must be between 1 and 15 and depends on
              the tape density. The default number is 1. Currently it is
              recommended that user sets blocking facter to 8 for tape
              density 1600. However, interchange mode must use blocking
              factor of 1.

     TITO   - fixed by TITO.


tape format 

     each user file is written as one physical record on tape with tape
     format description included. In TITO it is called "file header
     record". In DUMPER it is called "file descriptor block". They contain
     information such as the time tape is written and number of bytes in
     the file.  DUMPER has more potential for error recovery since it
     actually has a command "check" which checks to see if every file's
     file description block on tape agrees with the files on disk.

     DUMPER - emphasizes user access information, for example, date and
              time of the last non-write access to the file.  See table 7-
              4 of TOPS-20 USER UTILITIES GUIDE for the entries of file
              description block.

     TITO   - emphasizes tape parameters, for example, tape density and
              file number on tape.  See APPENDIX A of TITO USER'S GUIDE
              for the entries of the file header record.

          DUMPER can be run from a command file through a batch job, TITO
          can be run from a command file through a pcom job. This is not
          recommended because DUMPER and TITO often require terminal input
          in the middle of operation. For example, user has to input tape
          specification for each consecutive tape, or TITO may output
          messages such as "tape write parity error encountered,
          continue?". These interactive inputs are not possible through a
          command file.


     at command level:

          DUMPER - not available

          TITO   - the STORE, RESTORE, GET, and DIRECTORY command can be
                   followed by "@(filename)". The file following the at-
                   sign "@" is called an indirect file, and it may contain
                   anything which can be typed on the same line from the
                   terminal, with one important difference: carriage
                   returns in the file are automatically treated as
                   commas. Also, indirect files may not contain more than
                   62 filenames or 125 individual user names.


file selection options  

     wild carding:

          filename may contain wild card characters pound-sign or
          question-mark for TITO, percent-sign for DUMPER. Both DUMPER and
          TITO can take "*" as the filename or the extension of the
          filename to match all filenames or all extensions


     date selection:

          DUMPER takes the format of any standard American or European
          format such as 10-OCT-82 or 10/10/82 for date, and 24-hour or
          AM/PM format such as 17:17 or 5:17pm for time.  TITO takes the
          format of HH:MM DD MMM YY for hour, minute, day, month and year.
          DUMPER has more options than TITO for date selection. The
          following are the available options:

               DUMPER - BEFORE, ABEFORE, MBEFORE, SINCE, ASINCE, and
                        MSINCE commands transfers only files whose last
                        user/system written/access date is before/since
                        the specified date. See the general command
                        comparison table of section I of this report for
                        details.

               TITO   - CREATED AFTER and CHANGED modifiers to the STORE
                        command store only files created after the
                        specified date or have been changed since the last
                        backup

tape directories 

     DUMPER and TITO both have a "DIRECTORIES" command but with very
     different usage. DUMPER prints directory names on user's terminal as
     it saves or restores them by default. User can suppress such printing
     by the command "NO DIRECTORIES". TITO can suppress directory name
     printing on the terminal by the command "MODE TOTALS".  To do a
     directory of what's been saved on tape, the command to use in TITO is
     "DIRECTORIES", in DUMPER is "PRINT". TITO's "DIRECTORY" command
     prints out a listing of tape file names, position, user name,
     creation date, date written , file size and checksum on the terminal.
     This listing can go to a file by typing "COF (filename)" before the
     command "DIRECTORY". DUMPER's listing lacks tape positions and file
     creation date, also checksum won't be included unless user gives the
     command "CHECKSUM SEQUENTIAL/BY-PAGE".  It is easier to load DUMPER'S
     tape directories into a database and search them than TITO's,because
     although both TITO and DUMPER's tape directories have alphabetized
     user names, only DUMPER tape directories' filenames are alphabetized
     for each user name.
