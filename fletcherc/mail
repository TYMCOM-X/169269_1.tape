Subject: ATTACH by OPER to detached CHKPNT without license

Problem:  CHKPNT has license that OPER doesn't have and with
          the new restriction that you must have same or greater
          license (or JL) to attach to a job, it is impossible
          for OPER to attach to CHKPNT when it dies.

Objective:  Solve the problem without giving OPER any additional
            license, and without having to wait for the time-lapse
            which occurs when OPER must contact software support
            who has the license.

Idea #1:  Have OPER Kill the CHKPNT job, then run CHKPNT by hand.
	  This would work in most instances, but could fill up the
          accounting buffer before completed.  It also is in-elegant.

Idea #2:  Change the restriction to allow a frame with sufficient
          ability to attach (old style allowed same AUN or ACCT-SUP)
          and when the attach is made, reduce the frame-license of
          the target frame to the lesser of the frame-license of the
          two frames involved, but leave the process-license the
          same.  Thus, the current program could be continued without
          loss of process-license, BUT the user would NOT gain any
          additional frame-license!

          This could be interesting when a terminal is voluntarily
          given away, then given back... One would not want to give
          the command port away to a frame with LESS license.

Idea #?:  ???

Subject: Crash Analysis

The most recent crash analysis done was to trace the problem on system
930 with the tape drive crashing the system every time TITO tried to do
a tape directory.

Symptom:  RUN TITO and do a DIRECTORY ALL command
	  System crashes at EXCMPE+3, exec page failure

Tracing:  (reverse order)
	  EXCMPE: determine if exec & crash if a hard page failure
	  PGFAIL: come here when hardware detects a page fault
		  (trap locations stored in EPT+500-504)
	  OD.RF+11 was where the trap occurred, at interrupt level
		  in module F3TSER.
	  OLDRW1+?? was where the EPT map pages were setup for the
		  tape read transfer, at UUO level in module F3TSER

Problem:  Exec page fault was caused by "not enough" pages setup for
	  the transfer of tape data into the users buffer, or so it
	  seemed.

	  Actual cause was that the EPT map slot entries for the user's
	  data buffer were shifted, so that when the data was BLT'ed
	  from monitor space into user space through the EPT mapping
	  the pages were off by 1.  This was done at interrupt level.

	  At uuo level, when the EPT pointers were setup, a byte ptr
	  was used,  POINT 18,EPT+<%ONC/1000/2>,-1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>
	  which (for all intents and purposes) looks correct.  The
	  problem was that the third operand of the POINT pseudo-op
	  is taken as decimal, thus:  -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^D1000>&1> was the
	  calculation used instead of -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1>.

Solution: Change the formula to -1+18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1> and re-assemble
	  the monitor.

Time frame:  All of this took about a week digging through various
	     modules and comparing F3TSER with MAGSER and FTASER as
	     well as following the code through ONCE startup and using
	     executive DDT to look at the EPT map slots and user buffers.

/Carl

PS:  I, (Carl) did most of the digging, showing Osman, step by step
     as much as I could.  This just happenned to be a very OBSCURE
     bug, and it's lucky that nothing else was affected.

As far as I know, they have not yet put a customer up on system 24
and until they are ready to do that, we can use our 1-pack system to
dow what we will, of course, letting the shift-supervisor in CUPC or
letting Gary Perez know that we still want to use it.

Once a customer is brought up on it, it gets harder.  Same as what

Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Brnging the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

Subject: COEES TRU interrupt

At this point, there should be no problems in making the delivery schedule
of an operating system with a TRU interrupt installed.  The code has been
written and installed to set the limit and trap the interrupt.  This is
what "I" promised to have completed by the middle of July.

There is one complication!

COEES will still need a routine which sets the limit and takes the trap
from within a FORTRAN (F40) program.  Trivil task, except that the runtimes
already use the interrupt system, and I cannot give COEES a routine which
usurps the interrupt vector in use by the runtimes just to setup (add) one
interrupt cause for exceeding the TRU limit.  Again, trivial to change,
EXCEPT that sources (or even proper .REL files) containing the current
interrupt code are UNAVAILABLE or NON-EXISTENT.

Please locate the sources, or contact Tim Brengle about locating what
sources are available.  Until then, I can do no more.

Subject: TRU interrupt / FORTRAN-F40 library sources

Craig,
  I had no intention of making my "complaint" sound like a
UNION SHOP problem.  Of course, I understand that I'm going
to have to carry the ball to completion on the TRU interrupt
code.

  My point is that eithe we have lost the sources, or they
are archived somewhere (somewhere that I don't know anything
about because that was handled by our LANGUAGES group at
the time).  Tim Brengle was the person who handled FORTRAN
and F40 until he left.  I was under the impression that Stan
Derry had kept Tim as a consultant for F40.   That was why
I asked that he be contacted by either you or Jon.

  Jon says that Ken Holcomb may have some old sources.  So, I
will look into that.

  With the exception of the F4 library routine, all else has
been delivered to the customer.  P034/N04 has all the code
and has been tested thoroughly.

PS:  My complaint is more that we NEED additional people to
     properly get our work done.  Two (2) people cannot even
     possibly expect to get everything done.  (And right now
     we're not really even 2 people!)

Subject: TRU interrupt, my schedule

Craig,
  As I mentioned on Monday, the monitor with the TRU interrupt is UP
and running on system 26.  In talking with Angela, she caught some flak
about the version change P034/L21 to P034/N04 but I told her to explain
that /N04 is equivalent to /L35 (14 source changes).  COEES still wanted
to have had a new TRULIM routine by yesterday as well.  Sigh!

  Anyway, I told Angela to explain that that is a change to LIB40 and to
isolate possible problems that COEES was getting things in stages, i.e. it
would be a couple of days before I could tell her WHEN I'd have the next
version ready (with the new TRULIM routine).

  Since I spent all day and most of each night Friday thru Sunday getting
all of this ready (including searching for TRULIM sources) I did not get
some errands which I MUST get done, done over the weekend.  As such, I
will be working on the TRULIM / F40 stuff from home for the next couple
of days.  If you or Jon need me for anything, please send mail or call me
at home (415) 961-1082.

Ciao!

I've made the changes necessary for the TRULIM routine to work with
the new monitor.  As soon as I can re-construct a LIB40 transmittal,
I'll call Angela and tell her that it's ready.  As it stands, I may
have to back out one set of changes that Tim started to make to the
current sources (FORSE doesn't assemble), however, the archived copies
of FORSE.MAC exist and should be no problem.  I'm still working from
home, so feel free to call me, or leave mail.

Jon,  about the associate programmer, or tech-writer positions, let me
know when you'll have time to talk to Cheryl.  I'm trying to balance
her schedule between you and Dave Miller/Ron Saltgaver.  Thanks again!

Craig, Jon,
  All that's left is for me to finish digging through the last couple
of LIB40 transmittals to get a "good" copy of FORSE with which to make
the changes.  Tim left the current sources in a non-working state.  I'll
let you know as soon as I'm ready to give COEES a special LIB40.  Any
actual LIB40 transmittal is going to require a lot more work, and another

I'll do it later, so I can test the LIB40 stuff, when (if) it ever gets

    The current release of TYMCOM-X, version P034/N has been sent to
    the software distribution department to be installed on all Tymshare
    PDP-10s and customer DEC-2020s.

    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may

    nature and affect functions which are NOT performed on a regular
    basis.  These procedures are as follows:

        A.  Defining (re-building) a structure.
        B.  Changing a system number.
        C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
        D.  Diagnosing system startup errors.


    The attached document, OPER.MEM, contains a detailed explanation of
    the changes and how they may affect current procedures.  A detailed
    list of other changes should be available from software distribution
    as included with the release announcement which they send out with
    each new software release.

Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

Subject: TRULIM/FORSE sources to match (SYS:26)LIB40.REL

Well,
  After a week of scrounging, with little or no "luck", I found a
source file which generated a binary .REL file the same size as the
one included in LIB40.REL on system 26.  In a stroke of luck, it was
found that although it didn't match, the only difference was the
version number in module FORSE.  I changed the version, re-assembled
it, and VOILA!!!!  FORSE.MAC which generates the proper .REL file!

  A similar comparison shows that no changes were made to TRAPS.REL
(which contains TRULIM) and the ancient source that I found is still
valid.

  One last note:  System 26 has a different LIB40 than that of most
                  of the rest of the world, so I still need to perform
                  a cursory set of tests on system 26 before we give
		  it to COEES for testing.

  Delay!  System 26 has been down from 11pm til 5am for the past two
          days, so the testing will have to wait until this afternoon.


PS:  Jon, feel free to contact Angela and tell her she will have a new
     FTLIB40.REL for COEES to test by tomorrow (Thursday) morning at
     the very latest.  If all goes well in my testing, sooner. I will
     try to call her sometime Wednesday afternoon.

Subject: TRU limit code

I've just completed my testing and installed the new LIB40 on system 26
for COEES to test.  I've sent mail to Angela (rather than a phone call
since it is well after 6pm east-coast time) on system 26 relating the
current status.

Notes on general release of the TRU interrupt code for the rest of the
world....

  1.  F40 - LIB40 on other systems than 26 still need to track down
            proper source files via "trial and error" before a general
            release can be properly made.
  2. P034/P will be the first general release of the monitor to support
            the TRU interrupt, scheduled for October release.
  3. YAMM - Documentation release, also due in October will include TRU
            limit and interrupt descriptions as well as any other changes
            made for P034/P.
