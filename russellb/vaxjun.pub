 Below please find the configuration of the June Vax 11/780.  In order
for this system to shipped as the first or second Rabo system, the following
changes would have to be made:
 . add an extra 512k bytes of memory
 . change the tape drive from a TEE16 to a TU77
 . keep one of the RMO3 disk drive 
 . down grade the line printer to a 300 lpm printer
 . keep the DZ11-B
 . keep the DL-11 and DUP-11 communications devices

 Given all of the above configuration changes, I would like to recommend
that we not plan on shipping this system to Rabo.

 The June VAX 11/780 is configured as follows:
  SV-AXTVB-CA
   11/780
    512k bytes memory
    LA120 console
    3 REM03 disk drives and controller
    TEE16 tape drive and controller
    32 async ports (DZ11-A, DZ11-B, DZ11-E)
    DL-11-DA  Async interfaces
    DUP-11-DA  Sync interface
    LP-11-YA  600 lpm printer

 I will call in the morning to discuss the above.
