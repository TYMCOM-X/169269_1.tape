The following is an outline of the proposed Hardware Systems Support Groups's
 (HSSG) point plan for 1981.

   BASE

    Base is defined as the number of hours available to work on projects.

      For example, a year's base would equal approximately 52 total weeks in 
      the year 
      LESS:
        Employee vacation
        Tymshare holidays
        Internal training
        Sick and personal leave

      A manager shall be charged with 5 hours per day of project time. Non-
      management personal will be charged with 6 hours per day.

      The base for each quarter will be calculated from the actual days worked 
      in that quarter.

   THE PLAN
      
      HSSG is INSD's hardware support and consulting group.  In its support
      role, HSSG provides the following support functions to INSD:

           a.  Installation of Tymshare System XX's.
	   b.  Software distribution
	   c.  Backup technical support for the field with Tymshare System 
	       XX's.
	   d.  Order coordination for Tymshare Sytem XX's

      In its consulting role, HSSG provides the following consulting services
      to INSD:

	   a.  Software consulting to the IBIS project.
	   b.  Hardware consulting to the IBIS project.
	   c.  Hardware sizing.
	   d.  Dedicated system pricing.
	   e.  Contract review.
	   f.  Communications consulting  (ie. IBIS miniengine)

      The above items serve to exemplify the diverse activities within HSSG.
      Because of this varied range of activities, HSSG has devised a 2 part
      plan:  the first part a point plan based on field requests (projects);
      the second a list of pre-assigned tasks proposed by management to be
      evaluated upon completion.

      The group has also evaluated a revenue-based plan.  This plan was
      rejected because the products that HSSG deals with are defensive and
      not offensive in nature.  Such a plan would be defeating for the
      company as a whole.

      As consultants and support members, HSSG should be evaluated by three
      key variables that together measure the value and effectiveness of the
      group's contribution.  These variables are:  hours worked on each
      project, the value of HSSG's contribution and the importance of the 
      project itself.

   Therefore, the following equation can be stated:

      (hours per project) X (contribution + project importance) /2 = total 
      points for the quarter

   That is to say, hours per project is being weighted by the average of two 
   factors, contribution and project importance.  These two weighting factors 
   are numbers assigned on a continuum from 1 to 3.



   The project importance factor will be assigned by HSSG and Mike Seppi to all
   HSSG's current projects using the scale below.
   
   normal...............important...............critical
     1                       2                      3

   For example, current projects falling in the NORMAL RANGE would be:

    Major Opportunities
    Retailers
    Dedicated Machine Pricing
    Support of installed Tymshare System XX
    Tymshare System XX software distribution
    

   Current projects in the IMPORTANT RANGE would include:

    Coordination of hardware system upgrades
    Tymshare System XX upgrades
    Hardware "sizing"
    Customer vists
    Tymshare System XX benchmark assistance

   Current projects in the CRITICAL RANGE would include:

    IBIS
    Price Water House
    QOS
                        
   The importance weighting factor for each project will change as needed to 
   reflect the changing priorities.



   The contribution weighting factor will be based on the following scale:

   Standard................Significant...............Essential
       1                       2                         3

   A contribution factor will be assigned to each project based on the 
   following definitions.

      Standard Contribution

      HSSG contributes relevant data or information to the project but this does
      not directly affect the project outcome.

      Significant Contribution

      HSSG plays a key role in the outcome of a project.  It provides 
      information and analysis that influences the direction of the project.

      Essential Contribution

      HSSG's contribution is critical in directing the course of the project.  
      Their input is indispensable in assuring quality results.



   THE SPLIT

   To insure continued close work and co-operation between HSSG and the
   Business Analysis Group, there will be a 90%-10% split between
   the two groups.  That is to say,
   90% of HSSG's point plan will be based on the equation explained 
   in THE PLAN section described above and the remaining 10% will come from the
   Business Analysis Group's plan.
               
   BONUS POINTS

    Bonus points will be assigned to the following:

     Projects
      One (1) extra point per project a quarter, to encourage HSSG to work 
      on a diverse and wide variety of projects.  This will increase 
      responsiveness to the field while insuring that HSSG's expertise gets 

     Trips

      Seven (7) bonus hours per day. Trips are a severe disruption
      of the normal course
      of HSSG's duties yet nonetheless, are important to INSD and Tymshare as a 
      whole.  Trips increase communication, visibility and the field's 
      perception of responsiveness while at the same time providing the field 
      with valuable information and assistance.  Therefore, to insure HSSG is 
      able to take trips when necessary without severely offsetting the point 
      plan, bonus points are given per each day of the trip.
     
     Management Bonus
     
      At any point during the course of the year, management 
      may choose to assign HSSG bonus points as they see fit.

     Management Objectives
      During the course of the year, additional 
      objectives with associated points may be agreed to by HSSG and management.

      Hours worked on pre-assigned tasks will not be included in the 
      project hours.

      **  If a project point limit is established, then the points assigned for
      both Management Options and pre-assigned tasks will be counted outside
      of the limit.



      Calculation

         **Quarter**
              (Project 1 hours)*(importance+contribution)/2
            + (Project 2 hours)*(importance+contribution)/2
            + ...
            + (Project n hours)*(importance+contribution)/2
            
            + 1 point for each project
            + Trip points
            = Project points earned this quarter
                      
         **YTD**

            Project Points Earned YTD / Base YTD
            
            = YTD % of quota
            + YTD management objective points
            + YTD management bonus points
            = YTD HSSG points
                           
              YTD HSSG points * .9
            + YTD HSSG points * .1
            = YTD points
                    
         **Commission Caluculation**

              YTD points
            - 100 * 2 * YTD IB
            = YTD commisssions earned


            Commisssion is paid on a 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% quarterly reserve pay 
            out schedule.
