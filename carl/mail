Subject: Tymshare Unofficial Mail System

Its here folks!
You can send mail with the command
    SENDMAil name@host,name@host,name@host ... name@host
It will prompt you for a subject and the body of the message.  While
you are entering the body, you have the choice of including a file
or calling an editor.  These options are invoked with ~ commands...type
~? for a list of valid commands.  The ~ must be in column one.

You can read mail (as you have obviously discovered) by the command
    RDMAIL
It will display your mail and append it to the file MAIL in your home
directory.

You can only send to "known" hosts which currently include:
    39,57,897,930
    tymix	(NTD's VAX)
    OFFICE	(no need to specify which one)
    ONTYME
I will add other hosts on request.  Send requests to WRS@39.

Notes on OFFICE:
    They can't send mail back to us yet (their restriction).
    Sending to name@host.ARPA will forward via OFFICE-14 to the
    DARPA internet, however, the OFFICE host tables are not complete
    so some ARPA hosts may appear to not be there in which case you'll
    get the mail back with a non-delivery explanation.

Notes on ONTYME:
    If you wish to receive your ONTYME mail through TUMS, you
    need to register your account.  If you are self-confident,
    you can edit (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT - follow the examples exactly!
    Otherwise, send your ONTYME account name(s) and passwords to
    me at WRS@39.  Also, if you register, mail that you send will
    show up as from your account rather than TUMS.GATEWAY which
    might confuse the more narrow minded Ontyme users.

Features forthcoming:
    *	more hosts
    *	better user interface
    *	automatic forwarding
    *	mailing lists

Please report bugs, problems, suggestions and praise to
	    WRS@39
-Bill

P.S.
If you find that SENDMAIL doesn't work as a command, you may use
    R SENDmail
or, include the line
    SetSCM( "(XEXEC)MEXEC" );
in your INIT.SAI.  (you should do this anyway)  If you're not using
.SAI init file, look at procedure SetSCM in (WRS)SETTRM.SAI and
duplicate its functionality in whatever you do use.  If you don't
understand why you should use SCM, call me and I'll tell you, it'd
be nice to hear from you anyway.  -Bill

Subject: editors get a fair slice of the machine

I thought you might be interested in these statistics.  Notice the
standing of PEAK, VUE and EDITOR.  My experience seems to indicate
that these pretty well represent the amount of use they get as
opposed to their relative efficiency.  And by the way, if anyone
knows how to make the concurrent pascal compiler (39.42%) run any
faster you could save NTD a great deal of money.  -Bill

PS - this program (WRS:39)TRSTAT won't run on F3's due to its use
of double precision floating point, it might be fun to run on some
of the other systems though.

This chart lists the top users of system 39 by program name for the first
week of May 1984.  I hope that you will find this as intersting as I have.
I will run the program again later in the month when more data is available.

Subject: molasses mode

Hmmm, you know, I suspect there might be something making L run a bit slow
on 39 as well.  I don't think it has anything to do with 4-MEG, but that is
just a gut feeling.  Sutton put in some things in and around cache sweep
code to change something to fix some bug he imagined.  Also, some things
were changed by Todd in the SCNSER area regarding when it would be called.
In fact I tink I might have even made some change there as well.

My approach would be to try a couple bench marks.  One that does only CPU
work, one that does only DISK I/O and one that does only network (non-BIO)
I/O.  This will indicate what area to look in.  They don't need to be at
all elaborate - if its bad enough to notice only running for a weekend, it
must be pretty bad and will probably show up with even the crudest test.

Meanwhile, I'll look over P034.MEM and see if anything rings a bell.  Please
keep me posted.  You can use 39 as a 4-meg KL running /Lxx.  -Bill

Subject: P034/L09

Something worth looking into: (from P034.MEM)

    /L09
    ----

    Deleted command to clear Cache Sweep Done Flag in routines CSUNL: and
    CSVAL: in module PICON.  Not necessary since monitor waits every time
    for Cache Sweep Done interrupt.    /SUTTOND 11-2-83

If he was mistaken about it being unnecessary, this could have interesting
performance impacts.  Cache sweeps are done every time we do I/O.  This
code was put in by Ernie - not like him to do something unnecessary.  I
remember talking to him about this and trying to talk him out of doing it.
If you send me a dif file for this change, maybe something will ring a
bell from the conversation we had and my limited knowledge of cache
management in the monitor.

Subject: Sutton's hack to CACHE code

I've looked at this and I don't think it would be causing any delays.
I still want to look into it more to make sure that it's unnecessary,
it may not be safe.

I'm thinking about trying to do a SNOOPY on 39.  Interested?

Also, I started to look into why SCNSER didn't run more regularly
shortly after I came over here.  That question was never solved, and
in fact, I came up with a patch to change a few things but don't
remember what happened.

begin "flaming editorial"
    I wish people would refrain from changing code just because thay
    don't understand why it's there.  Every time you touch something
    there is a finite probability that it will cause a problem.  If
    you don't get a measurable benefit from a change, it shouldn't
    be made.  Sutton and I argued this point every time he called me.
    I hope that you and John are able to resist the many temptations
    that Dave seemingly was unable to.

No, I already looked at that.  It only happens at once a minute.  The
part that happens are reschedule time is pretty minor.

The first thing to do is make sure it is running slower and find out
in what area (I/O, CPU or Tymnet).

Could you or could you have someone retransmit LOGINN.  It needs to have RF
license in order to check for new mail.  It properly throws away its license
before trying to run the INIT file so there is no security problem.  I have
made no change to the code (except to remove an unused label, that if used,
would have been a security violation) so there is no need to have software
distribution reinstall the program, only archive the new source.  -Bill

Subject: ONTYME.DAT

Carl, Lois and Wilkes are removed from ONTYME.DAT on 39.  They shouldn't
have been in both 39 and 930's directory.  You will still have full
Ontyme service from just 930.  Its not clear if I want to have multiple
systems forwarding Ontyme mail or to route them all through one.  I
think I am moving in the direction of just one, but it will depend on
a few things.
Anyway, continue to add new subscribers to (MAIL:930)ONTYME.DAT, but
not any other system.  I'll let you know if there is any change.  Also,
if Wilkes is in TXS as well, he can have two entries.  One of them should
be receive only.  That is they will both be polled for incomming mail,
but only one will be used to send mail to Ontyme.  The one to be used for
both sending and receiving should have WILKES@930,WILKES@* while the one
to be used for only receiving should have WILKES@930 only.

Due to a typo in the location of the class, I thought it best
to go ahead and recreate this memo.  Redundancy maybe,
but clarity is significant in this case...

Account Supervisor Workshop (5/8)

SUBJECT>   THE IBM VALUE ADDED RELATIONSHIP


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This memo has three objectives:  First, to explain the IBM VAD (Value Added
Dealer) Program.  Second, to explain that the IBM VAD is forcing a change
from how EPM priced hardware products in the past.  Finally, to offer choices
when a sales situation for the IBM PC or PCXT will not meet the requirements
set out in the agreement between IBM and Tymshare, Inc.

The IBM Value Added Dealer Program explained.

The IBM PC or PCXT are two hardware vehicles Tymshare has for delivery of
its services.  The IBM VAD agreement is the administrative tool for
delivery of the IBM PC and PCXT to Tymshare.  The IBM VAD agreement works
differently than any other equipment agreement presently in effect at
Tymshare.  What makes the IBM VAD agreement different is the following ex-
cerpt.

"THE IBM APPROVED VALUE ADDED OFFERING IS AS FOLLOWS:  PC OR PCXT
ENHANCED WITH TYMSHARE'S COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE CONNECTING
TO TYMSHARE'S NETWORK COMMUNICATING TO A HOST."

All the elements stated in the above quotation must be present when an IBM
PC or PCXT is sold by Tymshare.  Furthermore, the emphasis of the sale must
be on the network application and not the IBM PC or PCXT.  This requirement
                                                                Page  2

is less restrictive than it seems.  Tymshare's added value is the network.
As for example:

*  An IBM PCXT sells for $8500

*  A customer may pay $12000 for the networked application on an annual basis.

*  The total cost for Tymshare's services are $20500.00.

The added value to the IBM PCXT is Tymshare's networked application.

Pricing policy is the next topic.

Pricing, product codes, configurations, along with the associated product
literature for the IBM PC and PCXT are undergoing some revisions.  The prices
quoted in the February ONTYME are good guidelines but are not accurate and are
subject to change.  Another ONTYME message will follow with standard product
codes and pricing reflecting the more common IBM PC or PCXT configurations.
The product codes are intended to make it simple to order an IBM PC or PCXT.

A New Way of Doing Business.

A new pricing system is necessary for the IBM PC or PCXT.  When the EPM 
Handbook update is published, the pricing section will reflect a SUGGESTED
LIST PRICE for the configuration listed.  Every time a standard IBM PC or
PCXT is ordered, an internal price transfer to the ordering Line of Business
(LOB) will take place.  The internal price and the suggested list price for
the IBM PC or PCXT does not vary with volume.  Therefore, business unit
managers are responsible for pricing the LOB's products.  The IBM PC and
PCXT now are part of the entire offering and not a separate product.  As
market conditions may vary, the business unit manager may elect to increase
or decrease the sale price depending on the specific business conditions.

What happens if the sale does meet the IBM VAD requirements?

Fear not, there are choices.  First, IBM gives encouragement to VADs to
apply for incremental application approval.  Which means giving IBM a business
plan for the proposed additional application.  Second, if the application is
not approved or is not of sufficient quantity, a call to IBM sales office or
a local IBM retailer to supply the hardware may save the computing services
sale.  Third, is to sell one of the other microsystems available through the
EPM handbook.  Digital Equipment's Rainbow products are available now.  In
the near future, the TI Professional series and the Apple product lines will 
be additions to the EPM handbook.  The last choice is to find another
microcomputer system which meets the customer's needs and negotiate a new
contract.

EPM is now Distributed Systems Division (DSD).

DSD is here to help in all the areas listed above.  To best serve LOBs, the
business unit managers should submit to DSD the following:

*  Market Place Description

*  LOB Product Descriptions

*  LOB organization chart with the names, telephone number and ONTYME 
   address of the business unit manager who is responsible for setting product
                                                                Page  3

   pricing.

*  Technical overview of the LOB products and how its products are part of
   the computing network.

The information received will make the job of VAD qualifications easier and, if
necessary, begin the approval process.

Send the above information to Dick Stapenhorst (EPM.D/STAPENHORST),
Tymshare, Inc., 20705 Valley Green Drive VG2-A04, Cupertino, CA 95014.

Subject: inter-ontyme messages

Well, if TUMS was valid on EMSEE,
from EMSAA you could send mail to EMSEE as follows:
    put the line
	THS.WILKES@Emsee.Ontyme.Tymnet (TUMS)
    as the first line of the message and send a copy to TUMS.GATEWAY.

As you might suspect, this will work for any TUMS address, for
example, 
	WRS@tymix,WRS@930,WRS@OFFICE,Tymshare@SUMEX.ARPA (TUMS)

However, TUMS.GATEWAY isn't valid on EMSEE so as far as anyone but
Wilkes is concerned, EMSEE doesn't exist.

If people are really being assigned to other than EMSAA, then I
should see that TUMS is validated elsewhere.  Meanwhile, Stuart
is working on inter-host messages as a part of Ontyme (inter-
Ontyme that is).  That is supposed to be done and installed later
this quartr.  -Bill

     CUPERTINO, Calif., May 11, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc. has signed
an agreement with Graybar Electric Co., of St. louis, Mo.,
making Graybar an authorized distributor of the Scanset(TM) line
of personal information terminals and miniprinters.

     The association with Graybar will open channels to sell
Scanset equipment through Graybar's 180 sales offices nationwide.

Subject: format for error return line in YAMM

The YAMM presently uses a nice variety of formats for the error return
line in UUO's etc.  I'm not sure such a variety of formats is either
helpful or advisable.  Therefore I am soliciting opinions as to the
preferred form.  The present variety includes
	  error return		; AC/ error code
	 error return	<AC> := error code
	  error return		; ac := error code
	 error return	;  <ac> := error code
	 error return	;AC contains <error code>
	  error return	; c(<ac>) := error code
	  error return		; ac/ error code

All comments appreciated.

   Yes, I've tried it, and I find myself in a quandry.  I want to do
   set SCM, but I also want to run my INIT program too. It (INIT)
   already chains to TURNUP, so I'm annoyed that the effect of set SCM
   cannot be accomplished without chaining.

Subject: Cache sweeps

Cache is unloaded one location at a time in a least-recently-used
fashion in order to make room for new locations.  Other than that
and explicit sweeps, it will not get unloaded of its own accord.
It does make sense for the change Sutton made to the crash code.
It assures that the crash dump is meaningful.  Otherwise, a location
which was very recently touched might be in cache while we dump the
old version from memory.  Of course, the most recently written
locations in a crash are usually the most interesting and the most
likely to be lost to such a bug.

Now, Dave's change may have been unnecessary if the crash dump disk
driver does a cache sweep or similar operation.  I don't know if it
does or not.  It is pretty primative, and I would guess it doesn't.

   As you know, it's about tym, our newspaper for employees and their

number of publications we're required to distribute has tripled, we need
to try a new distribution method for it's about tym:  we'll be sending
it, via interoffice mail, to you and your employees' office mailboxes.

   Managers, we need to know how many are in your departments.  Please
furnish this information in an OnTyme, along with your department name and
address, no later than Monday, June 4.  My OnTyme name is CORPCOM.IAT.

   By the way, we still want you to consider it's about tym a newspaper
for you AND your families.  We encourage you to take it home with you each
month.

bill & carl:

idea for work-around/fix for the mooing super-map bug/feature/restriction:

1. enable software interrupt for ill mem ref
2. when he tries to scribble on page 777, which has been super-mapped
   read-only, hit the interrupt handler.
3. vclear the offending page
4. create a private page 777
5. go back and try to scribble there again.

how's that sound??

Subject: no bull, cow.

Well, I think that you mean when you get the interrupt you'll simulate a
copy on write operation (this'll need two pages and a BLT).  That should
be pretty good - it'll allow you to test your code (assuming you trust
the interrupt handler) and then the resulting code will work on the old
monitor as well as the new one with super-cows fixed.  (do they make
super-milk?)  Anyway.  I haven't had a chance to look at the monitor
code yet, but I still think it should be pretty easy.  More later -Bill

PS - you should probably make sure that the effective address of the
offending instruation actually points to page 777 so you don't "handle"
an ill mem ref resulting from some other bug.  (watch out for the other
code using one of your temp registers as an index register)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Second Quarterly OnTyme Account Supervisor Workshop
will be held Friday, June 15, from 9:00 - 11:30 am.  We will
be meeting in VG2 Training Room.

Our goal is the same:  to enhance internal communication 
within our Company.  The fact that new developments are
quickly surfacing, due to the acquisition, strongly suggests
we must pool together our ideas and suggestions to achieve
this goal.

With this, it would indeed be beneficial for those who did
not participate in the 1Q Workshop, to join us this time -
we need you!  The role you play as an OnTyme Account Supervisor
is the backbone of our internal communications, and without
this, the flow of information may be delayed or even stopped.

At this time, the floor is open to discussion items.  Since
it is YOUR workshop, where I act as coordinator, participation
is essential.  Let me know via OnTyme or a quick call,
those items you wish to address.

I am absolutely positive questions about the changes occurring
with OnTyme, the use of IEMS (as 'pseudo Inter-OnTyme), and
OnTyme enhancements will be asked.  For this reason, I have
asked my manager, Eileen Riordan, to join us.

Please plan on attending.  I look forward to either seeing you
again, or meeting you June 15.  If your manager would like more
information - have them either contact me directly or send me
an OnTyme.

Back-up Supervisors are welcome to attend as well.  Please
confirm attendance by 6/11.  I'll publish list of attendees
by Wednesday, 6/13.

Subject: HOTLINE.LOG; On-line log of hot-line calls

As per a suggestion by LOIS (and others) the file (M33:930)HOTLINE.LOG
now contains a reverse-chronological log of HOTLINE calls, giving the
approximate date and time of the call, who it was take by, who is to be
contacted, system #, description of problem, solution if known, and the
current status, i.e. PENDING, FIXED, HOLD, etc.

The file is also an INFO node, for somewhat page-able access to recent
problems.  Anyone taking a call should try to look at the file and update
it where applicable.  This should help to keep down the incidence of
multiple people working on the same problem without knowing what has been
done already.  (The info node is "HOTLINE" under node "SUPPORT").

Hmmm, that is a compromise, but it probably makes sense.  It would be
hard to implement, though.  Remember the philosophy behind MANUAL is
that it will bring up the monitor without running any initialization
jobs only for debuging (of course it gets used sometimes for other
purposes).  Having the monitor up trying to talk to the network without
a KMC is quite useless, so I guess I cast my vote in favor.

Subject: ATTACH by OPER to detached CHKPNT without license

Problem:  CHKPNT has license that OPER doesn't have and with
          the new restriction that you must have same or greater
          license (or JL) to attach to a job, it is impossible
          for OPER to attach to CHKPNT when it dies.

Objective:  Solve the problem without giving OPER any additional
            license, and without having to wait for the time-lapse
            which occurs when OPER must contact software support
            who has the license.

Idea #1:  Have OPER Kill the CHKPNT job, then run CHKPNT by hand.
	  This would work in most instances, but could fill up the
          accounting buffer before completed.  It also is in-elegant.

Idea #2:  Change the restriction to allow a frame with sufficient
          ability to attach (old style allowed same AUN or ACCT-SUP)
          and when the attach is made, reduce the frame-license of
          the target frame to the lesser of the frame-license of the
          two frames involved, but leave the process-license the
          same.  Thus, the current program could be continued without
          loss of process-license, BUT the user would NOT gain any
          additional frame-license!

          This could be interesting when a terminal is voluntarily
          given away, then given back... One would not want to give
          the command port away to a frame with LESS license.

Idea #?:  ???

Subject: INITIA, etc.

I've always wanted to eliminate the "force" kludge.  The monitor ought
to do create frames followed by run frame - just like anyone else.  Of
course this can't be done except at #7 interrupt level.  This is a pretty
radical change, however, and clearly shouldn't even be considered until
after /M is out and stable.  The other alternative is to perpetuate the
kludge and only start INITIA on the line that runs KMCs if the system is
MANUAL and its a 2020.  This would be a pretty straightforward change,
none the less, touchy - I'd still recommend waiting.  -Bill

Since 39 is an NTD machine, you don't have to clear it with all
the normal channels.  Just check with me and operations, then
put it in (SYS:39)SYSTEM.SAV.

Normally, you'd call Gary, but since its a weekend, just call
the lead operator and see if they want to bother Gary.

If you can take care of this today, it'll come up after the
power shutdown, tomorrow.  Otherwise, it'll be another week
unless it crashes.

Subject: CHKPNT problem

The restriction says...
   if the FRAME license of the source is < the FRAME license of the
   destination, do not allow attach.  Please note that the FRAME license
   of CHKPNT ought to be 0.  That is, unless someone set it otherwise.
   The CHKPNT program has PROCESS license (as does any program) only.
Conclusion:
   Either there is something else causing the problem,
   or somebody started CHKPNT by hand and had more FRAME license than OPER,
   or there is a bug in the code in ATTACH that checks license.
Regardless,
   even if the current procedure worked, it is gross and usually faild due
   to operator error anyway.  If the operator types anything other than
   R CHKPNT after attaching, the system will hang in accounting wait
   forever, including the operator job.  CHKPNT should be made more
   intelligent about this so one can always say R CHKPNT.  Bear in
   mind that the only thing preventing doom is that the dead CHKPNT is
   still there with the ACT: device still init'd.  Once this frame is
   disturbed in any way which would cause a RESET or RELEASE (e.g. LOGOUT),
   the world will effectively end with a grand (but deadly) embrace.
Solution:
   Module ACTSER:
	1. Find check for username who owns ACT: being made exempt from 
	    accounting wait.
	2. Change it to be the username who most recently owned ACT:
   Program CHKPNT:
	0. if frame is detached, procede as normal (skip this junk)
	1. look for job owning ACT: and see if its running (JS.RUN).
	2. if ACT: owner found, and running, ask oper if it should be killed.
	3. if no frame already own ACT:, create one under OPER
	4. HALT - do not STOP - the old frame if running
	5. RUN CHKPNT (use .gtFPN) in the child frame (do not do .foCLR)
	6. print CHKPNT running in frame XXXX message and exit
Note:
   If the ACTSER change is made, the rest is sort of unnecessary since the
   kill old procedure Carl mentioned would then work (but won't now).

Subject: HOTLINE.LOG; On-line log of hot-line calls

As per a suggestion by LOIS (and others) the file (M33:930)HOTLINE.LOG
now contains a reverse-chronological log of HOTLINE calls, giving the
approximate date and time of the call, who it was take by, who is to be
contacted, system #, description of problem, solution if known, and the
current status, i.e. PENDING, FIXED, HOLD, etc.

The file is also an INFO node, for somewhat page-able access to recent
problems.  Anyone taking a call should try to look at the file and update
it where applicable.  This should help to keep down the incidence of
multiple people working on the same problem without knowing what has been
done already.  (The info node is "HOTLINE" under node "SUPPORT").

Subject: ATTACH by OPER to detached CHKPNT without license

Problem:  CHKPNT has license that OPER doesn't have and with
          the new restriction that you must have same or greater
          license (or JL) to attach to a job, it is impossible
          for OPER to attach to CHKPNT when it dies.

Objective:  Solve the problem without giving OPER any additional
            license, and without having to wait for the time-lapse
            which occurs when OPER must contact software support
            who has the license.

Idea #1:  Have OPER Kill the CHKPNT job, then run CHKPNT by hand.
	  This would work in most instances, but could fill up the
          accounting buffer before completed.  It also is in-elegant.

Idea #2:  Change the restriction to allow a frame with sufficient
          ability to attach (old style allowed same AUN or ACCT-SUP)
          and when the attach is made, reduce the frame-license of
          the target frame to the lesser of the frame-license of the
          two frames involved, but leave the process-license the
          same.  Thus, the current program could be continued without
          loss of process-license, BUT the user would NOT gain any
          additional frame-license!

          This could be interesting when a terminal is voluntarily
          given away, then given back... One would not want to give
          the command port away to a frame with LESS license.

Idea #?:  ???

Subject: CHKPNT problem

The restriction says...
   if the FRAME license of the source is < the FRAME license of the
   destination, do not allow attach.  Please note that the FRAME license
   of CHKPNT ought to be 0.  That is, unless someone set it otherwise.
   The CHKPNT program has PROCESS license (as does any program) only.
Conclusion:
   Either there is something else causing the problem,
   or somebody started CHKPNT by hand and had more FRAME license than OPER,
   or there is a bug in the code in ATTACH that checks license.
Regardless,
   even if the current procedure worked, it is gross and usually faild due
   to operator error anyway.  If the operator types anything other than
   R CHKPNT after attaching, the system will hang in accounting wait
   forever, including the operator job.  CHKPNT should be made more
   intelligent about this so one can always say R CHKPNT.  Bear in
   mind that the only thing preventing doom is that the dead CHKPNT is
   still there with the ACT: device still init'd.  Once this frame is
   disturbed in any way which would cause a RESET or RELEASE (e.g. LOGOUT),
   the world will effectively end with a grand (but deadly) embrace.
Solution:
   Module ACTSER:
	1. Find check for username who owns ACT: being made exempt from 
	    accounting wait.
	2. Change it to be the username who most recently owned ACT:
   Program CHKPNT:
	0. if frame is detached, procede as normal (skip this junk)
	1. look for job owning ACT: and see if its running (JS.RUN).
	2. if ACT: owner found, and running, ask oper if it should be killed.
	3. if no frame already own ACT:, create one under OPER
	4. HALT - do not STOP - the old frame if running
	5. RUN CHKPNT (use .gtFPN) in the child frame (do not do .foCLR)
	6. print CHKPNT running in frame XXXX message and exit
Note:
   If the ACTSER change is made, the rest is sort of unnecessary since the
   kill old procedure Carl mentioned would then work (but won't now).

Subject: pcom and license passing on :39

    Carl,

    Is it a feature of PCOM or the monitor that license passing does
    not work on :39?  The only way I can get my tiny little child
    frame to do grownup things is to explicitly set license in the CTL
    file.  Naturally, this can be accomplished through watertight and
    surrepetitious means, so that the security of life an large is not
    jeopardized, but the discrepency with :930's behaviour is worth
    noting.

    While we're on the subject, why is it that when I say "init<cr>"
    on :930 it runs my Init File (ala noname), but on :39 is just says
    EXIT?

    /ken

    PS, it's weird being here (@39) and sending mail there (@930)!

Carl:
First, thank you for fixing 23.  That certainly seemed like the best solution.
No point spending hours on it.

Debbie called on the hot line last night to report that 24 was giving
"frame capacity exceeded" and no one could log into it, even though only
OPER was logged in.  I had them recycle, going back to the K-10 monitor
on the theory that there still was a possibility Mallinckrodt might need
it and there was no sense leaving up the L25 just in cast the problem was
L related.  Of course, if the customer doesn't need it, we should go back.
I did not tell her to crash and take a dump, but if it happens again that
should be done.

The changes I made were very 39-job-mix specific as well as only making
sense for 4-meg machines (and only KL's).   I'm sure we can come up
with a generalization, but it will take some time.  Thanks for the
BLOCK-IO idea - I think that would be just fine.  Even when someone is
doing BLOCK-IO to a human (IE FTYPE), it isn't interactive.  BLOCK-IO
really can't be interactive.  (oops - I speak too soon - doesn't MAGNUM
use it for screens? - oh well, MAGNUM never was interactive, either).

It doesn't really matter to me.  VMP doesn't mean much, but we've been
calling it that for a long time.  Oh, one more...

.chDVP - devirtualize page
.chFIL - file (as in the verb "to file", like place in a file)
.chPPF - put page in file
.chSPF - stick page in file

Subject: TRU budgets (TRUCTL and PAM)

Here's the scoop on TRU control...(air sickness bag advised):

1. TRU budgets are set by NONAME, TRUCTL or UPDLUD in the LUD.

2. When a user logs in, LOGINN copies the TRU budget into the UFD.
   Note: there is presently a bug preventing this from working for
   GAN 3 users.  This bug has been carefully researched and has been
   found to be unfixable.

3. Every 15 minutes or so, PAM (PJ) runs a job that checks for schedule
   100000.  If so, it then looks at the accumulated TRUS for all jobs
   logged in to controlled user names, and subtracts them from the
   budget in the UFD.  If it reaches zero, PAM does a HANG UUO.  LOGINN
   also checks to see if it has reached zero when logging in.

(this is slightly condensed - there are actually two variables in the
UFD - one for limit and one for TRUS left this period usualy a day)

Anyway, to my knowledge, SET LIMIT is the only access to the job TRU
limit.  There should be a SETLIM calli which sets it and returns its old
value.  And of course, the new interrupt - which if not enabled when the
limit is reached will just stop the job like it does now.  And of course
last, but not least, a new option for HIBER - sleep until tru limit
exceded.  This can be optomized - take code from TYMCHG.

Gee, I just had a thought, if you made it a frme attribute, rather than
a CALLI, you could use the existing read/set frame attribute UUO.  Then
PCOM and similar jobs could set the limit on their children and watch
for a TRU LIMIT EXCEDED halt status.

Subject: TRUs

I don't know about the frame attribute stuff.  I think its all set up
to use the UPT.  It may just be easier to add it as a seperate UUO.
Since its in a job table, no problem poking it.  I guess you should
have whatever frame access you need to stop the frame.  As for relative
stuff, certainly, in fact I suspected that would be the default.  As
for allowing continue to work, that's no big deal.  It is not a security
thing where we have to protect the user from himself.  If the user gets
TRU LIMIT EXCEDED and types CONTINUE then he should get what he asked for.
I probably won't remember to call you, but I'll be in VG2 tomorrow
afternoon so I'll drop in (late afternoon).

Subject: 56 problems

To Carl, Osman, Bill:
56 started today having numerous jobs in FC state (all but 4 in MAGNUM).
They are running a K monitor, and I know there is a real question whether
jobs ever come out of FC wait in K.  

Anyway, the system was recycled and at first there were numerous "lack of
DDB" problems with cannot init device, cannot open file, fatal MAGNUM errors,
etc.  Only 40 some jobs at the time.  While I was looking at it, the problem
seemed to improve some, and this was not the deteriorating problem that we
used to see with L as repeated tries would result in success.  At the moment
the system seems to be working, but it all leaves me with an uneasy feeling
(at best) as it does Fred Canning.

Ideas?  Comments?  Help?

To Carl and Osman:
Sunday, every time the directory command was given to TITO, 930 would
crash (gave Bill good practice in reloading 930, anyway).  Tried with
different tapes, different monitors, same result.  There is a note on
the tape drive so Bobby won't do an incremental.

Carl, the crash would occur (like a timeout delay) even before the
"TAPE POSITION" prompt.  What is TITO looking for there?  Also, Carl,
when you tried to load L28 you got the READ ERROR OR EOF error.  Really
hard to reload when no one is here to take care of such problems.

Thoughts on the TITO problem?

Some experimenting this morning revealed that DIRECTORY command works
fine with L21, but crashes the system with L25 (or L27).

So--, we are leaving an L21 up for now.  Strangely enough Bobby did
incrementals all last week and that worked fine.  With the L25 the tape
moves past the load point as if the system is trying to read the first
record, and then, down she goes.

For those Account Sups who were unable to attend, here is a
brief outline:

A.  Why better response lately?

    1.  We now have two internal systems, with Tymnet and NTD
        on a new engine, 2261 (II), and the remainder of our
        internal accounts on 832 (AA).  With this, it is 
        necessary to communicate using an outside service -
        IEMS - WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH AN ACCOUNT ON ANOTHER
        SYSTEM.

    2.  IEMS is simple to use - proper format is necessary, however:
        a.  Sending to single userid(s)--
    
            1)  At the top of your message, you must indicate to IEMS
                WHO you are sending to AND the engine (AA or II).
            2)  At the bottom of your message, you must type NNNN.
                This indicates to IEMS you are finished with your
                message.
            3)  Type :SEND *** ONTYME
                                                                Page  2


        b.  Sending to a file (public distribution list)--

            1)  At the top of your message, you must indicate to IEMS
                the name of the public file which is on the other 
                system AND the engine (AA or II).  [For example,
                *** TYM (II).]
                NOTE:  IF YOU SHOULD NEED TO SEND TO A LARGE NUMBER OF
                USERS ON ANOTHER SYSTEM, AND A PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION LIST
                IS NOT AVAILABLE -- CREATE YOUR OWN, GIVE IT A FILENAME,
                AND SEND THIS INFO TO IEMS.SUP ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM.  WHEN
                YOU NEED TO SEND TO THIS FILE - FOLLOW #1 EXACTLY.

            2)  At the bottom of your message, you must type NNNN.
            3)  Type :SEND *** ONTYME

    3.  What is *** ONTYME??
 
        a.  *** ontyme is a 'mailbox' whereby at regular intervals, IEMS
            will pull messages at regular intervals and 'ship' them
            to the appropriate destination (userid and engine) indicated
            at the top of the message.
   
        b.  Note the 'regular intervals', IEMS is not instantaneous as
            OnTyme is - give IEMS about a half hour to hour to deliver
            your message.

        c.  If by chance, you have typed the incorrect userid to
            be delivered to the other host - the exact error message
            (ie:  NO SUCH RECIPIENT) will be delivered back
            to you.

B.  McDonnell-Douglas & OnTyme

    1.  Currently, we have several accounts set up for MDC's different
        companies.  Any requests should come through OnTyme Marketing,
        with the name of the individual, Company (not just MDC - McAuto,
        Health Services, etc.), and time zone.

    2.  If anyone should know of userids set up within Tymshare accounts,
        please let us know and we will set userids within their
        own appropriate account.  

    3.  The above is extremely important, due to the fact that when we
        have a larger reorganization, we can distiguish who's who.  Thanks
        for letting us know of ANYONE set up inappropriately.

        definition of an Account Sup.  If you have difficulties
        with the role defined, bring it up at our 3Q OnTyme
        Account Sup Workshop.

        2.  *** ACCT<O>SUP.GUIDE is the new filename for the

I don't find any entries in the Hotline log since (before in file) 14Jun84.
Is that because nothing has happened or nothing has been logged?
I like the idea of a computer accessible log because I can get to it from

How about always sending TUMS mail if the file (MAIL)MAILER.SAV is

     Peter, reference your Ontyme of June 20th on subject "Erroneous
     details on SLIGOS host 90".
 
     I have now had a meeting with the Tymcom X group and MIS (accounting)
     on this subject; the results are not necessarily positive.
 
      1.  When a PCOM job is run the "originating node of entry" is set to
          zero, because a node cannot be identified, as it is not an
          interactive session.
 
      2.  A node number of zero is automatically defined as a U.S. node
          number.  Hence, any job run during your evening hours is inter-
          rogated and understood to run during prime time.
 
     This would happen for any client using PCOM.  Usage of Perp and Defer
     are handled correctly because we take advantage of a specific Europe-
     an Perp processing host.
 
     This problem is not easy to resolve; it will require a change to code
     associated with the Tymcom X monitor.  Carl Baltrunas is aware of
     what changes are necessary, but timing on a fix has alternatives:
 
      1.  Depending on research which Carl will undertake it may be possi-
          ble to make changes to the next release of Tymcom X monitor code
 

 
Tymcom X details related to PCOM jobs                               Page 2
 
 
          (version N, due for release during next few weeks).  This would
          likely mean that very little testing could be done in advance,
          which leaves things a bit to chance that other problems could be
          presented.
 
      2.  We could wait and make the code changes in a later version of
          the monitor, likely due about October '84.  This would allow
          proper testing and limit possible exposure to other problems.
 
     The decision to be made depends on how serious this problem is to
     Cegi Tymshare.  We realize the accounting is being reported incor-
     rectly, but you do go through certain processes which alter the
     accounting for clients in your territory.  Is it possible for you to
     find an interim solution through your own accounting?  If yes, then
     it would be wise to wait until the release in the 4th quarter.  If
     you do not have a way around this problem then I would suggest we try
     to make the change as soon as possible (again, if Carl is able to
     ascertain that it's possible in a short time frame).
 
     Another alternative which is possible, but likely places a large bur-
     den on the MIS accounting group, is to re-run the CT accounting each
     month, after replacing a node of zero with a known CT node number.
     This alternative could present problems if anyone at CT is using rou-
     tines (assembler code) which eliminates node-of-entry in some fashion
     or another.  It is my feeling that this alternative would delay
     month-end accounting for CT, which would not likely help the 'cash-
     flow' situation.
 
     So, this is the state of the problem at hand.  We look forward to
     your comments and thoughts.  I'll keep you posted on Carl's progress
     as it relates to the above.  Regards. Ken

	Since Grandpa was here from out of town decided to spend the time

  Ken,
 
  Thank you for your intervention concerning this matter.
 
  If the  patch Carl Baltrunas  plans on  making, will solve  the problem,
  then that is fine with us.
 
  Concerning approval from SLIGOS, I have tried to contact the appropriate
  people, but  they have either  left the company,  or are on  vacation. I
  feel however that it  is also in their interest that  this patch is made
  quickly, so please go ahead as soon as possible.
 
  Best regards.
 
  Peter.

Subject: Crash Analysis

The most recent crash analysis done was to trace the problem on system
930 with the tape drive crashing the system every time TITO tried to do
a tape directory.

Symptom:  RUN TITO and do a DIRECTORY ALL command
	  System crashes at EXCMPE+3, exec page failure

Tracing:  (reverse order)
	  EXCMPE: determine if exec & crash if a hard page failure
	  PGFAIL: come here when hardware detects a page fault
		  (trap locations stored in EPT+500-504)
	  OD.RF+11 was where the trap occurred, at interrupt level
		  in module F3TSER.
	  OLDRW1+?? was where the EPT map pages were setup for the
		  tape read transfer, at UUO level in module F3TSER

Problem:  Exec page fault was caused by "not enough" pages setup for
	  the transfer of tape data into the users buffer, or so it
	  seemed.

	  Actual cause was that the EPT map slot entries for the user's
	  data buffer were shifted, so that when the data was BLT'ed
	  from monitor space into user space through the EPT mapping
	  the pages were off by 1.  This was done at interrupt level.

	  At uuo level, when the EPT pointers were setup, a byte ptr
	  was used,  POINT 18,EPT+<%ONC/1000/2>,-1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>
	  which (for all intents and purposes) looks correct.  The
	  problem was that the third operand of the POINT pseudo-op
	  is taken as decimal, thus:  -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^D1000>&1> was the
	  calculation used instead of -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1>.

Solution: Change the formula to -1+18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1> and re-assemble
	  the monitor.

Time frame:  All of this took about a week digging through various
	     modules and comparing F3TSER with MAGSER and FTASER as
	     well as following the code through ONCE startup and using
	     executive DDT to look at the EPT map slots and user buffers.

/Carl

PS:  I, (Carl) did most of the digging, showing Osman, step by step
     as much as I could.  This just happenned to be a very OBSCURE
     bug, and it's lucky that nothing else was affected.

Darren has sent me mail (logged in as Darren:39) asking how to
transfer files from 930 to Tolerant using TUMS.  I answered,
but I also changed his MUD password, and deleted his oper name
on 930.  You might want to keep an eye out for him, this all
sounds very strange.  If its just something harmless, one of
us can send him the file.

May I suggest setting up a new GAN on 930 for guest accounts.
Put ex-gan 3 people in it when they quit so they can still log
in to send mail or whatever, but won't be able to read/write
access all the sources or private directories.  (remember, most
of the accounts like M33 are setup to let any GAN 3 user GFD).

TYMSHARE ACQUIRES PRODUCTION CONTROL SERVICES, INC.


     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 9, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc. announced
that it has acquired the major assets of Production Control
Services, Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif.  Terms of the acquisition
were not revealed.

     Production Control Services, with sales of $1.5 million
in 1983, provides repair and support services to the computer
industry.  The company repairs and sells spare parts for a wide
range of disk, tape and memory products made by Ampex, Cal Comp
and other original equipment manufacturers.  At the time of acquisition,
Production Control Services had an inventory of $20 million.

     By merging Production Control Services into Tymshare's
Computer Systems and Support (CSS) division, it is expected that the
combined operation will post sales of about $18 million in 1984,
according to John Swarbrick, vice president of CSS.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field maintenance,
equipment staging and field engineer training for computer equipment
                                                                Page  2

and related peripherals from such companies as Digital Equipment
Corp., Honeywell and IBM.  These services are used by Tymshare
internally and also are available under third party maintenance
agreements for customers throughout the country.

     A new leader in the certification of removable media disk
heads Production Control Services has under development a
portable disk head certification unit for use in the field.
The device will result in significant cost savings to users 
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, 
and by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.
Swarbrick said the new portable unit will be available in the
fourth quarter of this year.

     Tymshare, Inc. offers a broad range of computer services,
and is part of the newly formed Information Systems group of
McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

    A fellow calling himself INSD.J/O'CONNELL ((201)981-2879) called
    me from Newark New Jersey or some such place complaining that
    COEES is having trouble recompiling their SAIL INIT programs on
    :29, even though said programs reportedly compile fine on :36.  A
    clue is that they use (FTSYS)SAIL.  My guess is they include some
    horrible module which on :29 was not compiled under the same
    version of the SAIL compiler as the one on :36.

    I looked at the version of SAIL on both systems, and find no

TYMNET VERIFIES ADDITIONAL PC COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE PACKAGES

     SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6, 1984 -- Tymnet has verified seven
additional software products that add terminal emulation capbabilities
to personal computers.

     Until recently, personal computers could not access a
wide range of business applications via low-cost, dial-up ports
on public packet networks.  PCs could access only those services
designed for use with ASCII-compatible asynchronous terminal
devices.

     Vendors now are developing software that enables PCs
to emulate certain intelligent terminals that are supported by
TYMNET's(R) 3270 service.  TYMNET allows a number of smart
asynchronous terminals to emulate IBM 3270s, including Digital
Equipment Corporation's VT100, Lear Siegler's ADM 3A, and the
IBM 3101.  A PC that can emulate one of these terminals can
thereby access an array of 3270-compatible applications and
facilities via TYMNET, in addition to ASCII-compatible services.
Tymnet's verfication service includes evaluation of such
software.
                                                                Page  2


     One of the products recently tested and certified is the
Crosstalk package by MicroStuf of Atlanta, GA.  Crosstalk consistently
has been rated the most popular communications package on the
market by Softalk magazine.  This package enables IBM PCs to
appear as members of Digital's VT100 terminal series.

     Three other software packages that enable IBM PCs to
emulate 3270s have been tested and verified as TYMNET-compatible.
The packages are VTERM by Techland System of New York, NY,
TYM/COMM by Tymshare, Tymnet's sister company based in Cupertino,
CA, and BLAST, by Communications Research Group, Inc. of
New Orleans.

     TELETERM, by Telexpress, Inc. of Willingboro, NJ, permits
the Tandy TRS-80 to emulate the Digital VT100.  This is the first
package that has been verified for the TRS-80.

     The VT/E000-3-01 by P2/I of Albuquerque, provides VT100
emulation for Fortune 32-16 micro-processors.  It is the
first package verfied on the Fortune system.

     In addition, Forte PC 78 by Forte Data Systems, Inc. of
Santa Clara, CA, has had its PJ3278 and PJ3279 package verified.
This enables 3270 emulation with the IBM PC.

     Other personal computer communications software and
hardware packages currently are being tested in Tymnet's
verification program.  Vendors of PC communications software
who wish to participate in the program are asked to contact Tymnet
Public Network Services Product Marketing Group, 2710 Orchard
Parkway, San Joe, Calif., 95134; phone (408) 932-5071.

     Tymnet, Inc., a McDonnell Douglas company, operates TYMNET, one
of the world`s largest public packet data communications
networks.  TYMNET provides local access from more than 500
locations in the United States and from some 50 countries.
The company has installed more independent data networks than
any other public supplier.

Dear Carl,

     I have managed to fix the problem which made it impossible to use

the DEL key on my Hotline program.  The problem was in the macro

"bs", which I had defined as follows:  bs = <('10)>;

The following SAIL code:  If (C neq bs) then
                            Print(bs);
                          Print(" " & bs);  Which is only executed

in the event that C = '177 or '10, did not work because (C neq bs) always

returned false and the neccessary bs was never printed.

     The problem was solved  by changing the macro definition of bs

to bs = <(null & '10>).  With C declared as an integer, bs must be a

string in order for things to work out.

                              Regards,
                              Helge

To Ken and Carl:
I now have a modem, and a card for the PC so that it works!  I notice that
N was generated (and all the disk space gone).  Hope things are going well
for all.  I miss PEAK, but am getting used to Final Word (after a brief,

Hmmm, indeed a problem.  Perhaps MONED could make the PCOM command

stuff like that anyway, such as making a transmittal file.  -Bill

Hi. It is now 3:05. I couldn't remember (so, what else is new?) whether I
was supposed to come back here after my errands or not. So I came back.
Actually, I'm sitting here typing this on your terminal, hoping that it will t   take longer for me to do this than it will take you to finish whatever you
are doing and come back here. It just occurred to me that you may still be
in your meeting, so call me when you get ghome, Okay?

Subject: New Peak

    Yes, it's true!  The latest version of Peak, though lacking the
    incredible WARPLD fast-start feature, does have timer-generated
    checkpointing, and therefore spends the bulk of its time in TI
    (rather than SL) state.  This should result in a greater rapport
    with the Tymcom-X scheduler, making the Peak experience a bit
    friskier in loaded situations.

    Let me know if you notice any problems arising from this giant
    leap in Technology.  Use SENDMA.

     He has made the necessary patch to the monitor on host P90 in order
     to fix the problem related to PCOM.
 
     Please let us know if all looks okay once you receive the accounting
     for July; the first day for which things should change, therefore
     accounted for correctly, will be July 19th.
 
     Please let me know the results of this patch, either way (if things
     are fixed or if they are not).
 
     Future support requirements for Tymcom X should be directed to or
     copied to user id TXS.SUP, with copies to the appropriate individual
     and to us here in IOD (IOD.HQ).
 
     Best regards. Ken

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In anticipation of the physical inventory of fixed assets, please review the
two sets of instruction prior to the tagging of assets.

1.  PHYSICAL INVENTORY OF FIXED ASSETS - INSTRUCTIONS

In an effort to correct errors in the Corporate Fixed Asset Records (PIMS),
we have requested that each office location take a physical inventory of
specific assets, as indicated in the attached instructions.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INSTRUCTION PACKAGE IS COMPLETELY READ BEFORE

YOU BEGIN TAGGING AND RECORDING ASSETS.

If there are items or concerns not covered by these instructions, please call
or ontyme (before you begin tagging):  Ellen Martino (408) 446-6521
Fin.E/Martino or Duane Wong (408) 446-7168 Fin.D. Wong.

Please make sure you know which items are owned by the Company.  Items on
lease from outside the company are not to be tagged.
ALL COMPANY OWNED EQUIPMENT LOCATED AT EMPLOYEE HOMES MUST BE BROUGHT IN FOR
TAGGING AND RECORDING.


Complete instructions for taking the inventory are attached.  In brief:

1.  We have purchased pre-printed tags to be used in the inventory.  An asset
    control log sheet has been designed for recording the tag numbers and
    asset descriptions as outlined in this memo.

2.  The surface of the asset must be cleaned in order for the tags to success-
    fully adhere to the surface.  A fast drying agent such as rubbing alcohol
    or Windex should be used to clean the surface first.

3.  When applying the tag, go over it with your thumbnail to ensure that it 
    is firmly attached to the surface.

4.  There are nine pieces of information to be filled in on the asset control
    log for each item inventoried:

	a.  Name:        printed name of person doing the tagging.
	b.  Date:        of tagging
	c.  Location:    location numbers as indicated on the enclosed
                         inventory information form.
	d.  Manufacturer:full manufacturer's name as indicated on the asset.
	e.  Model:       the Manufacturers model number.
	f.  Description:  description of asset tagged.
	g.  Serial Number:  the full serial number including any prefixes
	h.  Asset tag #: the number under the bar coding on the tag.
	i.  Other:       cost center number - to receive monthly depreciation
                        expense.




page 2

5.  The asset control log is to be filled out according to the detailed
    instructions.  After you have completed the inventory,
    the asset logs and the Inventory Information Forms are to be mailed
    to:  Property Accounting, attention:  Duane Wong VG1-A02 at

    c)  Please hold onto any unused tags as they will be used on new 
        fixed assets per separate instructions.

    d)  Make certain to check closets, storage areas for assets, etc., and
        tag those assets that belong to Tymshare.

    e)  For tags that have been destroyed, please account for them on the
        asset control log.

    f)  Tymshare's assets that have been loaned to consultants must be
        brought in for tagging.

                  TAGGING OF THE NEW FIXED ASSET EQUIPMENT PURCHASES

As we conduct the physical inventory of Company Fixed Assets, it is equally 
important for new capital equipment purchases to be tagged in an accurate,
timely manner.  The tagging system that you are using for the physical 
inventory will, therefore, be continued as a means of maintaining and
controlling accurate property records.

Attached is the procedure for tagging new equipment purchases.  ONLY THOSE 
IDENTIFIED AS CAPITAL ASSETS (FIXED ASSETS) ARE TO BE TAGGED.  The current
capitalization policy states:

  "As of January 1, 1984, all new asset purchases with an individual cost
  of $400.00 or greater and an estimated life in excess of one year will be
  capitalized.  This applies to only company owned equipment, not equipment
  that is on lease or on loan from a vendor."

If an item, as defined above, is going to be purchased, a requisition form
authorization for capital expenditure form, (and numerical analysis form
if over $35K) must be completed and approved per the purchasing and
capital spending policies.  The asset must be coded to the proper 16XX
property account number on the forms.

After you have received a purchase order and requisition back from
purchasing, check the account number again to make sure that the item(s)
were approved as capital equipment.

Upon delivery of the equipment, place the tag on the equipment and fill
out the asset control log per the attached instructions.  Send the
original asset control logs once a month to:

     Tymshare, Inc.
     Fixed Assets Department
     Attention:  Fixed Asset Supervisor
     V61-A02
     20705 Valley Green Drive
     Cupertino, CA 95014

     Copy:  To be retained at the assets location

We hope that through the use of this tagging policy, our future physical
inventory will be clean and less painful.

FIXED ASSET   -   ASSIGNMENT OF ASSET TAGS - PURCHASED CAPITAL ASSETS -
                                   INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:

In order to maintain and control accurate property accounting records, all new
capital asset property must be tagged upon receipt from the vendor.  A copy of
the tagging record must be sent to Corporate Fixed Assets.  The tag number will
be added to the property record in the Fixed Asset (PIMS) system.

FORMS

Asset Control Log and Tags

I.  Upon delivery from the vendor, each new capital asset must be tagged and
    recorded on the Asset Control Log.  New Capital assets are defined as 
    property that is Tymshare owned, has an individual cost of $400 or more
    and a life greater than 1 year.  This includes swaps or replacements for
    existing equipment.  Fixed Assets must be informed of any swaps or
    replacements from a vendor.  Each tag contains a machine-readable number
    which will be read during our annual physicals with hand-held bar code 
    readers.

    a.  Pressure sensitive, pre-printed tag numbers will be provided by
        either Fixed Assets or your Division Controller.  Use left over tags
        from the current tagging process first.

    b.  Asset Control Logs will be provided by either Fixed Assets or your
        Division Controller.

II. Instructions for tagging and recording assets:

    a.  The surface must be clean in order for the tags to successfully
        adhere to the surface.  A fast drying agent such as rubbing alcohol
        or Windex should be used to clean the surface first.

    b.  When applying the tag, go over it with your thumbnail to ensure that
        it is firmly attached to the surface.

    c.  DO NOT SKIP TAGS

        If a tag is destroyed and not used, record the tag number and write
        DESTROYED on the Asset Control Log.

    d.  The tag is to be attached to the outside of each asset in an
        accessible place.  Use a flat, smooth surface on the back of the
        asset if possible.

    e.  The Asset Control Log must then be filled out with the following
        information in the boxes provided on the form.  Please use ballpoint
        pen and write hard.  DO NOT ERASE.  Cross out and use the next line.

1.  Name of Person Performing the Inventory

    Carl,

    Regretably, in accomplishing the last magic improvment to Peak
    (Checkpointing by timer), I had to make the redisplay know things
    about the command module that in other applications it has no
    business knowing.  To wit:

        o   external procedure C!DoChkPnt
        o   external boolean   C!TimIntFlg

    The unclean intelligence, fortunately, is confined to the routine
    T!GetC, which gets the next character(s) from the terminal.  The
    reason for its existence is that we must simulate a SAIL polling
    point in order to perform a checkpoint while we are in terminal
    input wait.  If you are curious about the mechanism, take a look
    at T!GetC.

    Sorry about the mess.

The objective is that each of the selected industries will
generate annual sales of at least $1 billion in 1990.

     Prior to his appointment to the team, Baer had been
president of Tymshare's payment services division.  He was

administration from Cornell University in 1970.

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services, and is

The message to operations managers reads very well from my

Sounds real good, hope evrything works to COESS's satisfaction.
Voew, if it is beeing check every clock tic no wonder why system
would be slow if lots of people have set TRU limit, if no body sets it
I think it wouldn't matter even every clock tic(execute one instruction),
Oh well looks like you are doing some real work while some of us goofing
around. I started the program (special command mode) it is very 
intersting and learning lot, hope to finish it next week.
Have a good evening and see you Monday.

Subject: COESS TRU interrupt

I take it that the sources containing the current interrupt code
are losts.  Who wrote that code?  Why is Tim Brengle involved?
It is not up to me to locate the sources.  This is not a union shop.
We will work together on the problem, but as you know there is
no one to pass it off to.  Therefore I expect you to carry the
TRU limit solution through to completion; not just strictly the
monitor part.

TYMSHARE'S IBIS DIVISION ADDS THREE MAJOR FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO ITS ROSTER OF CLIENTS

     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 23, 1984 -- Three major international
banking firms have signed contracts with Tymshare's International
Banking and Investment Systems (IBIS) division.

     IBIS(TM) is a total software product designed to meet the
trading requirements of the international banking and investment
community.  It runs on the Digital Equipment Corp.  VAX equipment,
and allows banks to link into the Tymnet public packet data
network to communicate with their data centers.

     The three banks are Credit Agricole, First American Bank
of Washington and the Bank of Bermuda.  In addition, Skandinaviska
Enskillda Banken of Sweden, already an IBIS user, is bringing
IBIS to its offices worldwide.

     First American Bank, based in Washington, D.C., will have
installed two VAX computers and IBIS software at its newly
opened New York office.  The contract is valued at about 
$1 million.
                                                                Page  2


     Credit Agricole, one of the largest banks in France, has
installed the complete IBIS product line in its offices in
Chicago, New York and London.  It will be used for international
foreign exchange trading, money market trading, commercial
loans and interbank checking and accounting.  The first system
will be installed in Chicago at a cost of about $500,000.

     The Bank of Bermuda, the largest bank in Bermuda, will
have the system installed on VAX 780 computers at its headquarters
offices at a cost of about $500,000.  In addition, the bank
will retain IBIS to provide ongoing consulting.

     Skandinaviska has installed VAX computers programmed with
IBIS software in its New York office, and plans to include
Frankfurt and Hamburg, Singapore, Luxemburg and London in a
worldwide expansion effort.  The cost of the complete installation
will be more than $1 million.

     IBIS is an integrated system built on a foundation of
modular packages than can function independently, or be
integrated into a whole.  It automates front office trading
and lending as well as back office accounting functions.

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services, and
is part of the  newly formed Information Systems Group of the
McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.  Tymnet, also a McDonnell
Douglas company, operates TYMNET(R), one of the world's largest
public packet data communications networks.

TYMNET CERTIFIES ADDITIONAL X.25 PRODUCTS COMPATIBLE 
FOR USE ON ITS PUBLIC DATA NETWORK


     SAN JOSE, Calif., July 16, 1984 -- As part of its ongoing
effort to support X.25 protocol, Tymnet has tested and certified
16 additional X.25 products compatible for use on the TYMNET(R)
packet data network.  About 100 products now have met the
requirements of Tymnet's certification program.

     One of those products, the integrated business exchange
(IBX), is the first PBX device that has been certified on the
Tymnet network.  Produced by InteCom, Inc., of Allen, Texas,
the IBX is a switch that permits simultaneous voice and data
exchange.  The switch is designed to be transparent to protocol,
and, in addition, features protocol conversion processes.

     Once the system is installed, users dial out to connect to
the InteNet packet controller, which switches the data to
X.25 protocol.  Using this protocol, the terminal has access
to the Tymnet network.

                                                                Page  2

     With the addition of X.25 implementation, InteCom can
offer its users greater flexibility in accessing any host,
terminal or printer, and provide broader data base accessibility.

     Also verified for use on TYMNET is the Hewlett Packard
HP2334A cluster controller.  The cluster controller contains
eight to 16 ports, which when connected to a terminal can
access TYMNET.  Data is converted from RS232 to X.25 protocol,
and transmitted over TYMNET, at a lower cost than using
multiple leased telephone lines.  The HP2334A can handle
up to 16 terminals, and is one of the few Tymnet-certified
products that will handle block mode as well as character mode
transmission.

     Additional X.25 products that recently have been certified
by Tymnet include:

     Amdahl:  4440 Network Concentrator.
     Altos Computer System:  Altos X.25.
     Cableshare:  CSI-X.25 Data Concentrator.

     A complete listing of Tymnet-certified X.25 products may
be obtained by calling the Tymnet Public Network Services
Product Marketing Group at (408) 942-5061.

     Tymnet, a McDonnell Douglas company, operates TYMNET, one
of the world's largest public packet data communications
networks.  TYMNET provides local access from more than 500 locations
in the United States and from some 50 countries.  The company
has installed more independent data networks than any other
public supplier.

Subject: p1.sai (Hotline program)

Greetings Carl,

     In my spare time I have made some minor improvements in my P1.sai

program.  In the first place, In the interest of compatibility, I have

substituted (SAILIB)sail.def definitions for my own definitions at the

top of the program.  Secondly, when the program is running and it asks

the user to enter the date, if the user just types the carriage return,

the system date will be inserted into the file; otherwise another date

can be inserted as before.  I am working on getting this to work on the

time-of-day as well.  The only problem is that when I run P1.sai, I get

the following message: POSSIBLE COMPILED CODE-RUNTIME INCOMPATIBITITY.
                       CONTINUE IF YOU DARE
                       Called from 4430  Last SAI call at 777777.

This message appears three times in succession as I advance by hitting

carriage return.  After the messages, the program runs as designed.  I

would be interested in hearing your thoughts as to why I get these

warnings and whether or not they can be supressed.

                                Regards,

look at them and see if that's what you wanted (don't think so). I
don't want to be unpolite but since you know exactly what you are

	I will call you if something comes up URGENT.

USAIR JOINS MARSPLUS RESERVATION SYSTEM


     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 25, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc., a McDonnell
Douglas company, and USAIR, Inc. have signed an agreement making
USAIR a participant in Tymshare's multi-access reservation system,
MarsPlus(TM).  MarsPlus enables USAIR to offer direct access to its
reservations system from travel agencies and corporate travel
departments throughout the United States.

     MarsPlus is a service that allows unrestricted and equal
access to each subscriber airline's reservation system.  It
provides unbiased information from which to select flights, shop
for fares and produce tickets from each airline's reservations
terminal.  Northwest Orient, Piedmont, Ozark, Republic, Pan
American, TWA and Eastern also participate in the system.

     Through MarsPlus, USAIR's reservation system will be
available via Tymnet, the international data communications
network.  Using inexpensive dial-up terminals (or personal
computers with modems), users can view each MarsPLus airline's
flight information and fares and also make reservations.
                                                                Page  2


     USAIR bookings through MarsPlus have increased steadily
as the airline has grown.  The addition of on-line access will
make it even more convenient for agents and travelers to book
flights, and will provide more accurate and reliable reservations
services, said Jose Ferguson, manager of MarsPlus marketing
and sales.

     "USAIR participation adds considerably to our system and offers
us an opportunity to expand the MarsPlus network in markets of
mutual interest," said Ferguson.

     MarsPlus is the primary reservation system in more than
400 U.S. travel agencies and corporate travel departments.
It is the only reservation system offering real-time access
to the carriers' own data bases, but is not operated or
controlled by an airline.

     MarsPlus is operated by Tymshare Travel Management Services,
a division of Tymnet, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., and of
McDonnell Douglas Informations Systems Group, St. Louis.

The World file will be updated on Wednesday, August 1.
If you have not updated your directory lately, I urge
you to do so.

And, if you still haven't joined the majority
of Account Supervisors who maintain a directory --
you will continue to miss significant Company
announcements and news releases.

Please have your requests for public update by Monday,
July 30.  Thanks!

Sorry I don't know anything about it.  I take it that it's not embedded
in F40's transmittal package? How about some other possible embedding?

    After our last live discussion, involving yourself and John
    Wilkes, I checked with my boss and he said he did not have any
    openings except for experienced language types and Unix/C major
    product designer(s).  He suggested that I suggest you look at the
    wall in the cafeteria.  It's his best approximation to current
    knowlege.  Remember that NTD seems to have a Tech Pubs group of
    some kind, as well as the Tymnet group to which Pat Morse
    defected.

    NAD sucks.  I'm not scheduled for ISIS programming class until
    October, by which time I'll be senile.  The guy I'm learning from
    is difficult to understand.  The design of the engine is bizarre,
    and probaly qualifies as Cruel and Unusual. 

    See you later.

Subject: p1.sai (Hotline Log Program)

     Carl,

          Since my last communication, I have made the following change

     to p1.sai:  when the program prompts for the name of person taking

     the call, if a <cr> (only) is then typed, the name of the person

     who is logged on for that session is inserted into the log file.

     Note:  When p1.sai starts to run, it lets the user know by printing

     the date,time, and user-name, before asking for any input.  The 

     user can then decide whether to use the shortcuts when date/time/

     name-of-person-taking-call prompts appear.

                                   Regards,
                                   Bill

Subject: Pressure


I don't seem to be able to do anything right lately, so I'm giving you a choice:I can either return to Walnut Creek, or you can change your behaviour. Look,
I know we're each under a lot of pressure lately, but each other is the last
person either of us should be taking our aggressions out on, don't you
agree? You may not have noticed it and you may not agree, but you have been
raising your voice to me a good deal more often lately, usually for no good
reason. I'm not saying I've been the easiest of persons to get along with latelyeither, but if the stress is getting to us both this much, maybe we need to
get away from each other. It just seems like lately you are tending to holler
many times when it simply isn't called for. If I bother you that much, I'll
leave. It's up to you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The current release of TYMCOM-X, version P034/N has been sent to
    the software distribution department to be installed on all Tymshare
    PDP-10s and customer DEC-2020s.

    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
    affect current operational procedures.  The changes are minor in
    nature and affect functions which are NOT performed on a regular
    basis.  These procedures are as follows:

        A.  Defining (re-building) a structure.
        B.  Changing a system number.
        C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
        D.  Diagnosing system startup errors.


    The attached document, OPER.MEM, contains a detailed explanation of
    the changes and how they may affect current procedures.  A detailed
    list of other changes should be available from software distribution
    as included with the release announcement which they send out with
    each new software release.

    If you have any questions, please send an ONTYME to me at the above
    mailbox address.  Thank you.

Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

    CHANGE   Change information about the system.
             CHANGE CORE   - changes the default minimum user core.
             CHANGE SYSTEM - changes the system number.

    FULL     Bring up the system with a FULL DSKCLN.  If there is any
             question about the integrity of the file system, then this
             command should be used in place of GO.  Unless authorized,
             DO NOT enter the FILES dialogue to set the DSKCLN type.

    GO       Bring up the system with the default settings and start
             the auto-restart process.

    FILES    Enter the FILES dialogue.  This is the subsystem of ONCE
             which is normally used ONLY for restructuring or repairing
             the disk file system.  The commands in this subsystem could
             damage the file system if they are used incorrectly.  If you
             are NOT sure of what you are doing, DO NOT enter this section.

    READONLY Bring up the system SHUT for emergency examination.
             Writing on the disk is prevented until DSKCLN has been run.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    CONSOLE  Allow the system to be brought up on the CONSOLE terminal ONLY.
             The system MUST be reloaded before it can be brought up on the
             network.  This command should be followed by a command to bring
             up the system (one of: GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY).

    NETWORK  Allow the system to be brought up on the NETWORK (default).
             This allows normal access to the system and overrides any
             previous CONSOLE or NETWORK commands.  This command should be
             followed by a command to bring up the system. (see CONSOLE.)

    DDT      Enter executive DDT.  To be used ONLY by software wizards
             for emergency patching and examination of the monitor.
             UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU NORMALLY USE THIS COMMAND!

    MANUAL   Bring up the system in the SHUT state for DEBUGGING ONLY!
             The auto-restart process is not performed.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    BOOTS    Crash the system with "BOOTS LOADED" immediately.

For KS-10 only:
    KMC      Bring the system up loading the KMC-11 but without the
             rest of the automatic restart procedure.  This must NEVER
             be used for a restart after a system CRASH.  ONLY to be
             used when the system has been taken down gracefully and
             DSKCLN has already been run.

      1.  Glad to hear that PERP is working again.
 
      2.  Robert Klute has given David Miller the software "key" to defuse
          the 1022 timebomb.  However, having just spoken to David Miller,
          he's not certain whether he can disable the timebomb before it
          explodes tonight at midnight (well into your day Wednesday);
          right now David is trying to reach Robert Klute about this.
 
      3.  Your point about correct contacts is well taken:  to all the
          recipients of this message please note that PeterPeterPeter StratmanStratmanStratman

2.  1022 timebomb (midnight tonight)
3.  Miscommunication and lost time regarding X/XX monitor release L
 
 
          Since over two years have transpired since the last monitor
          release, David Miller isn't sure how it was done in the past any
          more for C-T.  His suggestion:  he would like to handle this
          situation partly as he does for each U.S. host, namely:
           a.  (SYS)BACKUP.SAV is copied to (SYS)OLDMON.SAV .
           b.  (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV is copied to (SYS)BACKUP.SAV .
           c.  The new N monitor (replacement for L) is telecopied to
               (SYS)NEWMON.SAV .
 
          Note that then it would be up to the discretion of the local C-T
          operations staff to actually load the N monitor for each host.
 
          If my memory serves me, there used to be problems in this
          approach where C-T intentionally shut down certain XX's during
          the California workday.  It might be appropriate for C-T to pro-
          vide a list of all XX's which should receive the telecopied mon-
          itor, and in case David can not reach certain hosts, alternate
          host-username combinations to which he can telecopy the monitor
          files.
 
          In any case, may I suggest that this be worked out by Messrs
          Miller and Stratman.
 
     Best regards,
 
     - Peter  (IOD.HQ)

{2}  The fact that Carl may have incorrectly or confusingly addressed cor-
     respondence to CT on this matter, and that he still uses an exotic
     ONTYME name from an unpublished group is the natural consequence of a
     consistent lack of cooperation within Dick Ouellette's group toward
     repeated requests from Les Metour and myself for respecting Tymshare
     norms of communication via ONTYME.  Clair Levin, who recently worked
     in the field and understands the value of coherent and up-to-date
     ONTYME directories, is trying to help resolve this impasse.

Effective 7/1/84, the Payment Technology Department (PTD) will report into 
the Payment Transaction Services Division (PMTS).  Formerly part of the
Network Technology Division (NTD), PTD provides technical development,
support, and operational services for PMTS.  PTD is responsible for host
systems on Data General, Hewlett Packard, and IBM hardware, as well as a large
commitment to Tymnet based technology.

PTD Department Manager Joseph Oren reports to PMTS Division Manager Robert
Howell.  The newly consolidated organization will benefit from more closely
coordinated activities.  PMTS looks forward to continued rapid growth and
expanding opportunities, an environment which demands a synergy of efforts
between sales and marketing, on one hand, and the technical on the other.

PTD offices are located in Irvine Ca., Fremont Ca., and Chevy Chase Md.
Reporting to Joseph Oren in PTD are managers Joe Lusker, Alan Monath, 
Barry Ohara, Ed Quigley, Charles Regalia, Girish Shah, and Dan Thomas.
PMTS extends a warm welcome to these and other PTD personnel.  They bring
with them the talent and dedication which has been and will continue
to be a key element in the success of PMTS.

     With some embarassment I would like to correct some errors in my pre-
     vious memo to all of you.
 
      1.  The monitor release in question is N, which is to replace
          release L; the title of my memorandum was misleading.
 
      2.  Clare Levin has pointed out that as of yesterday there is now a
          *** DIRECT.DBSD, edited by Jan Turriff.
 
      3.  Although Carl Baltrunas sits near the DBSD group (managed by
          Dick Ouellette), he is no longer a part of it (as can now be
          seen by scanning the contents of *** DIRECT.DBSD), although he
          still works on Tymcom-X (and -XX) support; hence the continued
          use of the TXS.- account.
 
     So I am guilty of some miscommunication myself!  Sorry for any incon-
     venience this may have caused you.
 
     Best regards,

Subject: TRULIM/FORSE sources to match (SYS:26)LIB40.REL

Well,
  After a week of scrounging, with little or no "luck", I found a
source file which generated a binary .REL file the same size as the
one included in LIB40.REL on system 26.  In a stroke of luck, it was
found that although it didn't match, the only difference was the
version number in module FORSE.  I changed the version, re-assembled
it, and VOILA!!!!  FORSE.MAC which generates the proper .REL file!

  A similar comparison shows that no changes were made to TRAPS.REL
(which contains TRULIM) and the ancient source that I found is still
valid.

  One last note:  System 26 has a different LIB40 than that of most
                  of the rest of the world, so I still need to perform
                  a cursory set of tests on system 26 before we give
		  it to COEES for testing.

  Delay!  System 26 has been down from 11pm til 5am for the past two
          days, so the testing will have to wait until this afternoon.


PS:  Jon, feel free to contact Angela and tell her she will have a new
     FTLIB40.REL for COEES to test by tomorrow (Thursday) morning at
     the very latest.  If all goes well in my testing, sooner. I will
     try to call her sometime Wednesday afternoon.

     Eric, reference your Ontyme of July 6th on subject laser printer
     accounting.
 
      1.  Product codes do not presently exist for laser printing.  Howev-
          er, it will be no problem to add required new codes to the
          appropriate price codes.
 
          You mentioned the unit of accounting would be the printed page.
          The regular printing charges are based on two items: number of
          pages and I/O.  Do you wish this new service to reflect only the
          one product code, or both?  We can implement new codes fairly
          quickly, once we know how many are required.
 
      2.  Tymcom 370:  I have talked with Dick Rawson on the subject.  He
          has supplied me with a 3 page document by the name of 'Support
          Services Accounting BRS', dated November 23, 1982.  Yesterday I
          mailed a copy to you; this may be the same document you refer-
          enced in your memo.
 
          Dick stated he did not believe any changes would be required on
          his side other than understanding the mechanism by which you
          would be implementing the laser printing capability.  By this he
 
 

 
CT laser printing accounting                                        Page 2
 
 
          means that proper communication should take place so this new
          capability, once defined, is understood by all concerned.
 
      3.  I have had a brief discussion with Carl Baltrunas regarding the
          Tymcom X environment; this is a more complex issue and will
          likely require more time to evaluate and implement.  Very hon-
          estly, I am quite confused on what changes are required and how
          they would be implemented, but I'm certain Carl will assist as
          required.  I'd suggest the Tymcom X implementation wait until
          successful completion on the Tymcom 370.
 
     I look forward to your response, specifically with respect to item 1.
     Best regards. Ken

             Block I/O.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  Peter,
 
  I  have noticed  in  the  documentation files  for  the  last couple  of
  releases of the Tymcom-X monitor, that no  block i/o ports will be nego-
  ciated with  the Tymbase of 2020  machines. This restriction  for 2020's
  seems to be the  result of problems with block i/o  on one of Tymshare's
  customer 2020's.
 
  This surprises me a bit, and I would like to know the following :
 
  1.  What symptoms did these problems present  to have caused the modifi-
      cation to  the monitor. ( We  use block I/O frequently,  without any
      trouble ).
 
  2.  Will this restriction be applicable to  monitors created for CEGI in
      the future ?
 
  Thank you, and regards,
 
  Peter.

Jerry McCoy tried to officially schedule you as his replacement for
