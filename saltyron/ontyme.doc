                          INSTANT USERS GUIDE

                             March 20,1982

    Introduction:

       This guide is a quick users guide to the use  of  the  Ontyme  II
       message  switch  and  a  description  of how to use the Ontyme II
       system from a PDP-10 host.  This guide is not designed to replace
       the  online  documentation  for  Ontyme II but is just an instant
       user series designed for the casual user.

       Any errors or corrections to this guide  or  other  documentation
       should be sent to IMSONT.SUP on the Ontyme II system.

       Should you find that you are not valid on Ontyme II please  check
       the following:
            Does you organization have a local Ontyme account.  INSD and
            Marketing  groups  should  contact  the INSD representative.
            Independent groups, such as MIS, STD, Credit/Collections who
            already  have  received account status, should contact their
            organizational  representative.   If  no  account  has  been
            assigned,  mail  your request to Ron Saltgaver c/o Corporate
            HQ.  VG3/02.  An account application package  will  be  sent
            immediately.  Please fill out the form and obtain the needed
            signatures and send to  Ron  Saltgaver  20705  Valley  Green
            Drive, Cupertino, Ca.  95014.

            It will  take  about  3  weeks  for  the  Tymnet  Ontyme  II
            validations  to  occur  and  the documents sent back to you.
            Should you need a temporary name in the meantime, it is easy
            to accomodate.




    Ontyme II Overview

       LOGON (directly to Ontyme II)

          At the prompt for Please Log In:  type EMSTSHR<cr>.

          This will connect you to Ontyme II and return the prompt:  ID?
          You will then inter your Ontyme userid.  The system will  then
          prompt you for a KEY which is the local Ontyme II password for
          this specific userid.

          If the login is correct then the prompt ACCEPTED will be typed
          out.  Incorrect login will repeat with "ID?".

          Note!!!  You are not in text entry mode.  ALL COMMANDS MUST BE
          PRECEDED  BY  A  COLON.  Otherwise, you will be in text insert
          mode.
                                                                  Page 2


       LOGOFF

          There are several methods to leave Ontyme  II.   The  commands
          are  :LOG,  :QUIT, and others.  The :LOG command causes you to
          leave Ontyme II with no checking  for  pending  data  in  text
          areas  that  may  be lost.  The :QUIT command will warn you of
          possible loss of data.  If you do not mind  losing  the  data,
          follow the warning responce with a carriage return.

       Receiving Messages:  :READ ALL command.

          Once accepted by Ontyme II just type:

          :READ ALL<cr>

          Your messages will be printed or the message ALL MESSAGES READ
          will be printed out.

       Sending Messages:  

          Because the sending of messages requires the creation of  text
          data and the use of the Ontyme II editor, I will restrict this
          tutorial to the very basics possible and reference the uses of
          IMS.

          After acceptance by Ontyme, enter your text as though you  had
          type SEND USERID to the MAIL or IMS MAIL system.  You can type
          as many lines as you like  using  <ctrl>h  for  backspace  and
          <ctrl>Q  for  line  delete.   There  are no tabs at present so
          <ctrl>I will not succeed.

          Opon completion you type:

          :SEND USERID<cr> - e.g.  - :SEND IMSONT.SUP

          The Ontyme II Editor is modeled  after  the  IBM  CMS  EDITOR.
          Unfortunately  not  all  of  the IBM features are implemented.
          The basic Editor commands can be found  in  the  documentation
          and a few are as follows:

          :Up :DEL :Next :Change /string/string/ :TOP :TYPE

          PDP-10 users can create their text files  on  the  PDP-10  and
          send   it   on   to   Ontyme.   See  (FTSYSDOC)ONTYME.DOC  for
          information.

          Once a message has been sent, it is  removed  from  your  text
          data  area.   To  return a copy to your area you will need the
          :GET command and the identifier for the message (ususally a  1
          alpha  character followed by up to 6 digits).  Use the command
          as follows:

          :GET IDENTIFIER - e.g.  - :GET A34565<cr>

          This would be done to send a message on to someone else or  to
                                                                  Page 3


          append text to a recieved message and then sending it on.

    As with all tools, there are more  sophisticated  methods  of  using
    Ontyme  II.   For  those  of  you  interested  in these commands and
    variations, a reference  manual  has  been  given  to  your  account
    supervisor.   Additional  copies  of  the  reference  manual  can be
    ordered through the Tymnet Documentation Department.


    Ontyme II PDP-10 interface:






  This program is used to transfer files from a PDP-10 host to the  ONTYME
  message  switch system.  All text is transfered without translation.  In
  this manner the transfered file can contain both text and commands.

  This program is located on systems 25,28,29,33,34,39, 65.                                                        _

  To run the program type:

  -GO (FTSYS)ONTYME <CR>

  The following is a sample of the use  of  the  ONTYME  REMOTE  INTERFACE
  program.


 
 
 -GO (FTSYS)ONTYME
 
 ENTER ONTYME NAME: imsont.user   - your user id or the userid you own.
 
 ENTER PASSWORD: <does not print> - this is the ONTYME userid's 
                                 password and not your PDP-10 password.
                                 (passwords may not contain trailing 
                                 spaces since they will be truncated)
 
 ENTER FILE NAME: file13.mem  -  any legal PDP-10 file name
                 (When completed, the file name will be requested again.
                 While the file is being transfered the program will count
                 lines in the file and after every 25 lines the following
                 message appears:)
 SENT: XXXX
 
              (XXXX = NUMBER OF LINES TRANSFERED is printed when the
                  program has completed the transfer)
 
 ***  a second option to the file request is available.  This option
      enable the user to send direct commands to ONTYME as though
      he or she was logged in directly.
 
                                                                    Page 4


         This option is exercised by typing a percent sign (%) followed
         by the desired text string.

 Additional features of the ONTYME REMOTE INTERFACE system:
 
         Tab (^I) will be translated into spaces filling out to an even
         increment on 8.
 
         All text received from the ONTYME system after any command will
         be printed on the terminal.

 UNABLE TO BUILD CIRCUIT  RESPONSE:XXXXXXXXXXXX
 
         The circuit to the ONTYME system could not be built.
         The response number is decoded below:
 
 (X) BAD RESPONSE FROM MESSAGE SWITCH
 
    X    MEANING
 
    1    THE 'ID? ' MESSAGE WAS NOT RECEIVED.
    2    THE 'KEY?' MESSAGE WAS NOT RECEIVED.
