    This is a MAGNUM data base that is used for keeping track of transmittals.
The data base resides on TSUCOOP:930, the schema is TRANS.TRACK.  There are
two procedures in the system:  TTS is an interactive procedure for entering,
modifying, deleting, and displaying transmittal information; and TTS.REPORT
which writes a full report of all transmittals.

TTS.REPORT
    To produce a report, run FTMAGNUM from TSUCOOP:930.  If TRANS.TRACK does
not appear as the default schema, use the command 'SCHEMA TRANS.TRACK'.
'RUN TTS.REPORT' will then run the the report writing procedure.  The user
will be requested to enter the report file name; this may be any file name or
'terminal'.  Respond to any other questions that may appear, and the report is
written.

TTS
    To use this procedure, run FTMAGNUM from TSUCOOP:930.  If TRANS.TRACK does
not appear as the default schema, use the comand 'SCHEMA TRANS.TRACK'.  
'RUN TTS' will begin execution of the procedure; the prompt 'TTS>' should
appear.  The valid commands at this point are:  Enter, Complete, Modify, 
Delete, Testing, List, Outstanding, Help, and Quit; each command will be
discussed further.  Each of the commands may be abbreviated with the first
character.
    Most of the commands require a transmittal number to execute.  If no 
transmittal number is included with the command, TTS will try to use the most
recent, successfully accessed transmittal.  If there is no valid transmittal
number available to TTS, the user will be prompted for one.  Three items to
note:  one, the Enter command requires a non-existent transmittal and
therefore ignores any recently accessed transmittal; two, the Delete command
clears the number of the most recent access; and three, the Help and 
Outstanding commands do not change the number of the most recent access.

TTS commands:

HELP -- syntax:  H[elp]
    function:  Displays a list of valid commands with brief descriptions.

QUIT -- syntax: Q[uit]
    function:  Exits TTS.

ENTER -- syntax:  E[nter] [transmittal number]
    function:  Creates the transmittal and records the initial information.
    operation:  If the transmittal number is omitted, the user is prompted for
      one.  The number is checked to ensure that it does not already exist.  
      At the 'Enter Transmittal Number...' prompt a carriage return will 
      return the user to the 'TTS>' prompt.  After the transmittal number has
      been accepted, the user will be requested for the name of the software
      product, product version, the system type on which the software is used,
      the programmer's last name, the date of the transmittal, and whether or
      not the transmittal is archive only.  None of the items may be left 
      blank.  A request for another transmittal number will then appear.  If
      another transmittal is to be entered, give its number, otherwise just
      return.

COMPLETE -- syntax:  C[omplete] [transmittal number]
    function:  To complete the transmittal information.
    operation:  A "complete" transmittal is one that is either archive
      only and has an archive date or represents installed software and has an
      archive date, installation date, and memo date.  Upon execution the user
      will be requested for the information to complete the transmittal.  If
      the information is not known, a carriage return will leave the field
      blank.  At the request for another transmittal number, enter the number
      of another transmittal to complete, or just return to return to 'TTS>'.

DELETE -- syntax:  D[elete] [transmittal number]
    function:  Delete a transmittal and any associated testings.
    operation:  If the transmittal number is omitted and no recent one exists,
      it is requested.  If the transmittal exists, its basic information is
      displayed and conformation requested.  If the responce begins with "y"
      the transmittal and any associated testings are deleted.  Enter another
      transmittal number to delete or a carriage return to return to 'TTS>'.

MODIFY -- syntax:  M[odify] [transmittal number]
    function:  Allows changes to all transmittal information except for 
      testings.
    operation:  A transmittal number is requested if not included with the
      command and a recently accessed number is not available.  At the 
      'Field to Change...' prompt the user has several options.  Entering
      'help' will display the valid field names and other options.  Entering
      'abort' will stop all previously entered but unkept changes for a
      transmittal, a carriage return keeps the changes, both return the user
      to the transmittal number request prompt.  Return at the transmittal
      number request to return to 'TTS>'.

TESTINGS -- syntax:  T[esting] [transmittal number]
    function:  Enter, modify, and delete testing information.
    operation:  A transmittal number is requested if not included with the 
      command and a number from the most recent access is not available.  At
      the 'Test System...' prompt, entering 'help' will display instructions
      on how to create a new testing record, modify an existing testing, or
      delete a testing.  When finished with a transmittal just return at the
      'Test System...' prompt.  Return at the transmittal number request to
      return to 'TTS>'.

LIST -- syntax:  L[ist] [transmittal number or product name]
    function:  Displays all the information of the transmittal specified or
      all transmittals for product named.
    operation:  If neither a transmittal number or product name is included
      with the command, the transmittal of most recent access will be used.
      The last transmittal displayed becomes the most recently accessed.

OUTSTANDING -- syntax:  O[utstanding]
    function:  Displays all outstanding transmittals.
      An outstanding transmittal is one that is not complete.  Or simply, if
      it is archive only it lacks an archive date; or if not archive only, it
      lacks at least one of the following:  archive date, installation date,
      or memo date.
