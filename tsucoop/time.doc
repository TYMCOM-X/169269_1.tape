     Time sheets for the Tymcom-X  section are in a MAGNUM data  base on
system  36 under  user  tymxmts.  Individual  time sheets  are  in files
written  in  each user's  directory  by the  "generate"  command  in the
procedure  time.sheets and  loaded into  the data  base  when completed.
Projects and tasks  are added to  the lists by  the managers, or  can be
inserted  by  the  user  when  filling  out  the  time  sheet.   Further
information on preparing time sheets  can be found in "How to  Prepare a
MTS Time Sheet".

              WEEKLY LOADING AND GENERATING OF TIME SHEETS
                    

     Every Monday (or the first working  day of the week if Monday  is a
holiday) all time sheets should be loaded at 1 p.m., and time sheets for
the next week should be generated.

     To  do  this log  into  36, set  write  files license,  and  gfd to
tymxmts.   Run  ftmagnum,  run  procedure  time.sheets.   The  procedure
time.sheets has  basically three commands  other than "help"  or "quit".
"load" (which can be "l"), "generate" (or "gen" or "g") and "status" (or
"outstanding" or "out" or "o" or "s").  You will be using only the first
two.

     The command  "load all  {filename}" will load  all time  sheets for
"resources" in the data base who do not have a termination date entered.
If a file name is not given following "all", the next prompt will be for
a  week ending  date, with  the  default to  be used  in  brackets.  The
default  date will  be the  date of  the previous  Friday,  and carriage
return will use that date. If you want another date in the  current year
enter it in the format mmmdd as "apr05".  The file name can  be included
in the command line  as in "l loil apr05.tim";  this is the only  way to
reload a time sheet from the previous year as the program checks  to see
if a  date given  is indeed  a Friday in  the current  year and  if not,
changes the date used to the following Friday.

     If a time sheet has no errors, and the total hours are at least 40,
the time sheet will load without comment.

     If there are  any errors, MAGNUM will  report them.  Any  line that
contains an error will not have the hours loaded.  Either edit  the file
and  correct the  error, or  send  mail with  the error  message  to the
originator of the time sheet and  ask them to correct the error  and let
you know so it can be reload.

     If  anyone  has  a time  sheet  with  less than  40  hours,  a file
"time.msg"  will  be written  in  their directory  reporting  that fact.
MAGNUM will  ask if it  is all right  to create this  new file  with the
question "New  file - OK?"  or "Existing file  - OK?".  In  either case,
respond with "yes"  or "y".  If any  such files have been  written, upon
exiting the time.sheets command module, the file err.cmd will be written



                                   1

(again MAGNUM will ask if it all right to ceate the file) and a reminder
will be given to send mail @err.cmd.  In this case after leaving MAGNUM,
while  still  in  directory  (tymxmts),  send  mail   @err.cmd,  message
@time.msg.  If any time sheets  are blank, a message will be  printed at
the end of the loading reporting the names of those who have  blank time
sheets.  Send  mail to  the manager of  anyone with  a blank  time sheet
reporting that fact.

     After  loading  the  time  sheets,  issue  the  command   "gen  all
{filename}".  Again, if a file name is not given, there will be a prompt
for the date with the default  date given in brackets; in this  case the
default date will be the following Friday.  A carriage return  uses that
date, if you wish  another type it in.   If the time sheet  file already
exists,  another  file  called "mmmddx.tim"  will  be  written  into the
directory and a message will report that fact (and therefore you  do not
have to worry about overwriting a completed time sheet).

     After that, exit the command "quit" or "q".  

     If any time sheets are redone, load them individually.  The command
is "load loil {filename}"; again a default date can be used.
If you are reloading a time sheet that did not have 0 hours the
first time, use the command "reload loil {filename}" which has the 
additional capability to delete all the old records for the given date
and person.

                                REPORTS
                                

     Many reports can be generated using the procedure mtx.   The report
routinely generated each week  is the pc70 personnel status  report.  To
produce this  report run  the procedure mtx.  Give the  command "pc70.rs
<date>" where <date> is the date of the last Saturday before  the report
date in the form  mm/dd/yy.  For example, if  the report is for  May 14,
the command would be "pc70.rs 5/8/82".  Have this report written  into a
file on your directory.  Exit  this module and then print two  copies of
the report on the 350.  Give one complete copy to Mike Hinckley and give
Todd Corenson and Adele Newman copies  of their time sheets and of  all the
people in their units.

                                  Lois Lindley
				  Zonnie Williamson


     If  there are  any outstanding  time sheets  that get  done between
Monday at 2 and the  following afternoon, they should be  loaded Tuesday
afternoon and the pc70.rs report regenerated to the same file.

     Print out  another copy of  the report and  burst and give  to each
person (except for Mike, Adele  and Bill).  If there have  been changes,
print another copy of the whole report for Mike.
