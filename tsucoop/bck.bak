                              CHANGING THIS MANUAL



              A copy of this manual (BCK.WRK) can be found  on  system
          930  in  (TSUCOOP),  along with the version of RUNOFF it was
          created in.  At the present time, the same version of RUNOFF
          is   in  (UPL),  and  can  be  implemented  by  the  command
          GO (UPL)RUNOFF.
                                                                 Page 2









                          SYSTEM 930 BACKUP PROCEDURES




          SYSTEM 930



          System 930 is on TYMNET.  If you are on BUBBNET, you must go
               to TYMNET by typing 'C' at the login prompt.

          At command level, you can be in either  XEXEC  mode  or  PDP
               mode.  The prompt for PDP mode is '.', while the prompt
               for XEXEC mode is '-'.  The two modes are very  similar
               but  there  are  differences in control characters.  To
               delete a character in PDP mode use backspace, in  XEXEC
               use  control-A.   To  delete  a  line,  use contol-Q in
               XEXEC, control-U in PDP.

          The normal screen editor to use is PEAK.  Manuals  that  may
               be of interest are:

               1.  XEXEC REFERENCE MANUAL


               2.  TITO USER'S GUIDE


                                                                 Page 3


          INCREMENTAL BACKUP



          I.   Check the density on the tape drive to make  sure  that
               it is set at 1600 BPI.

          II.  Select the appropriate incremental tape from  the  tape
               cabinet.   The  tape selected will either be a new tape
               (i.e., one that is not already a  part  of  the  backup
               library)  or  the oldest incremental tape in the backup
               library.

          III. Place a write ring (generally black or yellow)  in  the
               back of the tape reel.

          IV.  Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

          V.   Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape  reel  stops
               moving and then push the ON LINE button.

                    **NOTE 1**                                        
                        The  READ,  SELECT  and  WRITE  ENABLE  lights
                        should be lit.
                    **NOTE 2**                                        
                        The  small  light  near  the  read/write  head
                        should be shining on a silver metal  strip  on
                        the  tape  marking the beginning of the usable
                        portion of the tape.  The tape is now said  to
                        be at load point.

                        If the tape drive is unable to detect the load
                        point properly, gently tap the photocell (this
                        generally  clears  up  the  problem)  and  try
                        loading  the  tape  again.   Push  the ON LINE
                        button, then the REWIND button (allow the tape
                        to  unload completely), thread the tape on the
                        tape drive and repeat step V.
                    **NOTE 3**                                        
                        If  the  operator  has  already  logged on the
                        system and has begun the backup  process,  all
                        of  the  above  steps  (I-V) must be completed
                        before 'DEVICE:' appears on the terminal.


          VI. The terminal session now begins.

                    **NOTE 4**                                        
                        Use a hard copy terminal.
                    **NOTE 5**                                        
                        If the message 'PLEASE SEE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE
                        ...TROUBLE LOGGING IN'  is  displayed  on  the
                        terminal,   enter   a   carriage   return  and
                        'PLEASE LOG IN:' should appear.
                                                                 Page 4

                    **NOTE 6**                                        
                        If  a  '.'  or '-' prompt is the last entry on
                        the terminal when it is time to do the backup,
                        type

                        K (C.R.) OR LOGOUT (C.R.)                        _ ______    ______ ______

                        and proceed with the backup procedure.
                    **NOTE 7**                                        
                        If  there  is  a  problem  during  the  backup
                        process, be sure to save the tape(s) on  which
                        files were written before the problem occurred
                        and label the tape reel(s) appropriately.  The
                        tape(s) needs to be saved because a change bit
                        associated with a file is reset as the file is
                        stored and if the backup is started again, the
                        files stored during the first dump will not be
                        stored during the second dump (i.e., the files
                        are lost).

                        A  second  semi-colon  may  or  may not appear
                        after  typing  the  semi-colon  following  the
                        system  number.  This all depends on whether a
                        local path or a network path to the system  is
                        being used.
                    **NOTE 9**                                        
                        The password is not echoed.

                        If 'SHUTPROJ' appears instead of 'PROJ', it is
                        alright to continue with the backup process.

                        It  is  important  that this statement appears
                        because it means that a write  ring  has  been
                        inserted into the tape reel.  If the statement
                        'TAPE WRITE PROTECTED' had appeared, it  would
                        have  meant  that the tape reel did not have a
                        write ring and the tape could not  be  written
                        on.

                        If the end of the tape has been reached before
                        the backup has been completed,  the  following
                        message will appear:

                        CONTINUE ON DEVICE:

                        The following steps should be taken:
                            1.  Push the  ON  LINE  button,  then  the
                                REWIND   button  (allow  the  tape  to

                            2.  Remove the tape from the  tape  drive,
                                remove  the  write  ring from the reel
                                and label the tape reel appropriately.
                            3.  Repeat steps II-IV.
                            4.  Push the LOAD button, wait  until  the
                                tape  reel  stops moving and then push
                                the ON LINE button.

                        DDMMDD  refers to DAY OF WEEK-MONTH-DATE.  The

                        done on (the previous Sunday).
                    **NOTE 20**                                       
                        If  a  backup  was  dumped  onto  tape  but  a

                        instructed  to  create  just a directory file.
                        It is not necessary that the tape reel have  a
                        write  ring  when  creating  this  file.   The
                        terminal session is the same as this one (step

                        the above command) should  correspond  to  the
                        date  the  backup was dumped, not the date the

                        It  is  important  that this statement appears

                        At  this  point,  we  will create a file which
                        will tell the location of  each  directory  on
                        the  tape.   If  the backup required more than
                        one tape, the tapes should be remounted in the
                        same  sequence  in  which they were written in
                        order to create the directory file.  When  the
                        directory  has  been  completed for a tape and
                        another has yet to be mounted,  the  following
                        message will appear:

                        The following steps should be taken:

                            1.  Push the  ON  LINE  button,  then  the
                                REWIND   button  (allow  the  tape  to
                                unload completely).
                            2.  Remove the tape from  the  tape  drive
                                and  remove  the  write  ring from the
                                reel  if  it  had  not  already   been
                                removed    prior   to   creating   the
                                directory file.
                            3.  Mount and thread the next tape in  the
                                backup sequence on the tape drive.
                            4.  Push the LOAD button, wait  until  the
                                tape  reel  stops moving and then push
                                the ON LINE button.

                ring  from the reel, label the tape reel appropriately
                and return it to the cabinet.

          IX.   Enter the appropriate information into the 930  BACKUP
                LOG and save the hard copy of the terminal session.
                                                                Page 12


                    ALLFILES BACKUP


                    For the full backup, follow the procedure for  the
               incremental backup, with the following changes:

               1.  Replace references to 'incremental tape' with  'set
                   of allfiles tapes'.
               2.  Replace the command STORE ALL CHANGED by STORE ALL.
               3.  The directory tape should  be  of  form  DDMMDD.ALL
                   instead of DDMMDD.INC.
               4.  There will always be more than one tape so you will
                   need  to  respond  to  the MOUNT NEXT TAPE command.
                   When re-mounting the tapes to create the DIR  file,
                   be sure to mount them in numerical order.

                                                                Page 13







          BACKUP CHECKS


              The following checks can be made to make sure  that  the
          backup went well:


                  1.  The number of files stored during the dump  (the
                      number of files stored is given in the statement
                      'STORE COMPLETE,...FILES') should be the same as
                      the number of files processed while creating the
                      directory file (the number of files processed is
                      given    in    the    statement   'TOTAL...FILES
                      PROCESSED.').  Occasionally the number of  files
                      processed  is  greater  than the number of files
                      stored, but there is nothing to be alarmed about
                      if  this  should happen.  If the number of files
                      processed is  less  than  the  number  of  files
                      stored,  report  this situation to an individual
                      listed in the section CONTACTS.

                  2.  Check the TSUCOOP directory  for  the  directory
                      file  created  (this  is the file created by the
                      statement       'COF DDMMDD.INC (C.R.)'       or
                      'COF DDMMDD.ALL (C.R.)',   where  DDMMDD.INC  or
                      DDMMDD.ALL  is  the  directory  file  name)  and
                      examine  the  information  regarding  this file.
                      Important information to  note  is  whether  the
                      file has actually been created and the number of
                      pages making up the file (the number of pages is
                      typically greater than one).

                      i.e.,  At  the  XEXEC  level  ('-'  prompt)  the
                      following  can  be  typed  in  order  to get the
                      directory for a given file:

                          DIR DDMMDD.INC (C.R.)
                          or
                          DIR DDMMDD.ALL (C.R.)

                      Examine the terminal session printout for  error
                      messages  appearing  during  the  actual dumping
                      process and during the creation of the directory
                      file.   Report  these  messages to an individual
                      listed in the section CONTACTS.

                           e.g., ERROR IN READING FILE:...
                                 ...TOO LITTLE DATA ON TAPE.

                                                                Page 14







              RESTORING FILES


              If it is not known what tape the  file  is  on  use  the
          string-search  utility  (SPL)FIND to examine the directories
          from incrementals/allfiles.
              .r (spl)find
          
              Target 1: fname .ext
          
              Target 2:
          
              search in: *.all
                .
                .
                .
          
            See page 16 of the TITO manual for a discussion of restoring
            files.

          930 MAIL


              If an allfiles or incremental is not done send  mail  to
          Adele and Lois to inform them of this.

              .send adele,lois
               TYPE LETTER:
               to: Adele, Lois
               from: your name
               Whatever was not done on date because of reason,
               it should be done on next date.

          BRINGING UP SYSTEM 930


              If system 930 should crash, the system should be  booted
          up.   It  is  recommended that if the operator is unfamiliar
          with the boot procedures he/she should  have  an  individual
          listed in the section CONTACTS demonstrate these procedures.

          SHUT OVERRIDE:
              If 930 is SHUT, login as TSUCOOP on a direct line to 552
          or  554.   The  date and time will need to be set first when
          the following message appears:

          date not set; type date as mm-dd-yyyy
          type time as; hhmm
          
          Then set license and type:
               !sched 0
          
          This will then allow logins over the network.

                     SYSTEM 118 (TOPS-20) BACKUP PROCEDURES





                   TOPS-20



                   TOPS-20 is on TYMNET.  If you are on  BUBBNET,  you
               must  go  to TYMNET by typing 'C' when you log in.  You
               must then log  in  again  thru  a  port  to  reach  the
               monitor.  One way to do this is:


                   Please log in:  TSUCOOP:118;tymnetpassword                                   __________________________


                   You then proceed to log in as described  below  for
               logging in at the console.


               CONTROL CHARACTERS



                   Two useful control characters to be  aware  of  are
               control-U  and  control-W.   Control-U deletes the line
               just typed, and control-w deletes the word just  typed.
               To  delete a single character, use the delete or rubout
               key.


               COMMANDS



                   If you wish to type a comment, type a semicolon  at
               the beginning of the line.

                   When typing commands, typing an (ESCAPE) after part
               of  the  command  will complete the command for you.  A
               bell will ring if there are not  enough  characters  to
               make the command unique.

                   The following are valid commands.  (A  '?'  at  the
               '@' prompt will give the following list.  A '?' after a
               given command (i.e.  systat ?) will give you  the  next
               alternative in the command.)

                   INCREMENTAL BACKUP



                   I.   Check the density on the tape  drive  to  make
               sure that it is set at 1600 BPI.

                    **NOTE 1**                                        
                        The 1600 BPI button should be lit.

          II.  Place a write ring (generally black or yellow)  in  the
               back of the appropriate tape reel.

          III. Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

          IV.  Push the LOAD/RESET button.

                    **NOTE 2**                                        
                        The  small  light  near  the  read/write  head
                        should be shining on a silver metal  strip  on
                        the  tape  marking the beginning of the usable
                        portion of the tape.  The tape is now said  to
                        be at load point.

                        If the tape drive is unable to detect the load
                        point properly, gently tap the photocell (this
                        generally  clears  up  the  problem)  and  try
                        loading  the  tape  again.   Push  the ON LINE
                        button, then the REWIND button (allow the tape
                        to  unload completely), thread the tape on the
                        tape drive and repeat step IV.
                    **NOTE 3**                                        
                        The  LOAD/RESET,  ON LINE and 1600 BPI buttons
                        should be lit.  The ON LINE button  lights  up
                        automatically  when the load point is reached;
                        however, the tape drive will occasionally  run
                        past  the  load  point  and rewind back to the
                        load point and the operator will have to  push
                        the ON LINE button on when this happens.

          V.   The terminal session now begins.

                    **NOTE 5**                                        
                        If at any time you tun into trouble a '?' will
                        give the various alternatives to the  command,
                        and 'HELP' will give you a full explanation of

                        following steps should be taken.

                        1.  Push the ON LINE button, then  the  REWIND
                            button   (allow   the   tape   to   unload
                            completely).
                        2.  Remove the tape from the  tape  drive  and
                            remove the write ring from the reel.
                        3.  Place a write  ring  (generally  black  or
                            yellow in the back of the next tape of the
                            incremental set.
                        4.  Mount and thread  the  tape  on  the  tape
                            drive.
                        5.  Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape
                            reel  stops  moving, then push the ON LINE
                            button.

    TOPS-20 INCREMENTAL BACKUP


                            **NOTE 11**                               
                                The  READ,  SELECT,  and  WRITE ENABLE
                                lights should be lit.
                            **NOTE 12**                               
                                The  small  light  near the read/write
                                head should be  shining  on  the  load
                                point.

                                If the tape drive is unable to  detect
                                the  load  point  properly, gently tap
                                the photocell (this  generally  clears
                                up  the  problem)  and try loading the
                                tape again.  Push the ON LINE  button,
                                then the REWIND button (allow the tape
                                to unload completely), thread the tape
                                on the tape drive and repeat step 5.

                    6.  Type 

                        MTA0:  (C.R.)

                        in response to the request  for  the  unit  to
                        continue on.

          VI.  Remove the tape from the  tape  drive  and  remove  the
               write  ring from the reel.  Obtain the listing from the
               printer and store in the cabinet with the tapes.


          VII. There is also a batch command procedure  that  will  do
               the incremental.  To run it,type:

               @sub dump

               This will generate the file DUMPER.LOG, which  you  can
               look at to see the directories that were dumped.  
                                                                Page 23


          CRASH TAPE


                   Every 2 weeks, when a full dump is  done,  a  crash
               tape  needs  to  be made.  This is done by submitting a
               control file.  First, mount the tape that's labeled 118
               Backup  Crash  - S20TAP.LPT - on the tape drive.  Login
               as TSUCOOP and enter the following command:

                    @sub sys:s20tap.ctl

               This will save all the directory and system  parameters
               on  tape.  It is possible that the tape will need to be
               used when bringing the system up.   Keep  the  printout
               that was generated.
                                                                Page 24







                   ALLFILES BACKUP


                   The procedure for the full backup is similar to the
               incremental backup, with the following changes:

               1.  Change any reference to MMM-DD-INC to MMM-DD-FULL
               2.  Change SAVE /INCREMENTAL:1 to SAVE /FULL-INCREMENTAL

                   The allfiles is done using 2 sets of tapes.  First,
               the  structure  PS:   is  dumped  and  then  OSS:.  The
               procedure is as follows:
               @LOG TSUCOOP (password)
               @ENA
               $MOUNT STRUCTURE PS:
               $MOUNT STRUCTURE OSS:
               $DUMPER
               DUMPER> TAPE MTA0:
               DUMPER> SET BLOCK 8
               DUMPER> CHECKSUM SEQUENTIAL
               DUMPER> SSNAME PS-mmm-dd-FULL
               DUMPER> LIST PS-mmm-dd-FULL
               DUMPER> SAVE /FULL-INCREMENTAL PS:
                        .
                        .
                        .
               Total files dumped = ...
               Total pages dumped = ...
               
               DUMPER>

                   When the backup for PS:   is  finished  the  DUMPER
               prompt  will  appear  again.  Rewind the tape and mount
               the first tape in the set for  OSS.   To  continue  the
               backup  for OSS:, the last 3 steps from above are used,
               except PS:  is changed to OSS:
               
               DUMPER> UNLOAD

          RESTORING FILES




          I.   If you don't know on which tapes a copy of the file  is
               dumped,  use  FIND.FIL or go to the printed listings in
               the cabinet and find the  most  recent  incremental  or
               full dump on which that file appears and get the proper
               tape.


          II.  Place the tape on the drive without a write ring.  Load
               the tape.


          III. The terminal session begins.  Log in, enable, and enter
               DUMPER.

                        restoring from a tape that was not created
                        using  DUMPER, special things will have to
                        be  done.   Consult  the  TOPS-20  'User"s
                        Utility Guide' or ask someone.

          MAIL




              If a backup was not done but should have been, send mail
          to  SYSTEM,  with  the  command MM SEND <C.R.>.  You will be
          prompted for the message.

          BRINGING UP TOPS-20



              If TOPS-20 is down, or goes down when  doing  a  backup,
          wait  a  few minutes and try again.  It should automatically
          restart.If it does not, contact some one on the 930  contact
          list.





              After the base for 118 (node 554) crashes and is brought

                    OFFICE-4 AND OFFICE-11 BACKUP PROCEDURES


             ***   NOTE:  Currently OFFICE-4 no longer exists here
                 so ignore any references made about it.   ***


          SAVASS BACKUP


              Execute the command  file  SAVASS.OF4  (OR  SAVASS.OF11)
          before  each  allfiles  or  incremental  backup.   Important
          information about the directory of OFFICE-4  (OR  OFFICE-11)
          is dumped during the execution of this command file.

          I.   Check the density on the tape drive to make  sure  that
               it is set at 1600 BPI.

          II.  Select  the  appropriate  savass  tape  from  the  tape
               cabinet.   The  tape selected will either be a new tape
               (i.e., one that is not already a  part  of  the  backup
               library)  or  the  oldest  savass  tape  in  the backup
               library.  There should be a savass tape associated with
               each set of allfiles tapes.

          III. Place a write ring (generally black or yellow)  in  the
               back of the tape reel.

          IV.  Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

          V.   Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape  reel  stops
               moving, then push the ON LINE button.

                    **NOTE 1**                                        
                        The  READ,  SELECT  and  WRITE  ENABLE  lights
                        should be lit.
                    **NOTE 2**                                        
                        The  small  light  near  the  read/write  head
                        should be shining on a silver metal  strip  on
                        the  tape  marking the beginning of the usable
                        portion of the tape.  The tape is now said  to
                        be at load point.

                        If the tape drive is unable to detect the load
                        point properly, gently tap the photocell (this
                        generally  clears  the  problem  up)  and  try
                        loading  the  tape  again.   Push  the ON LINE
                        button and then the REWIND button  (allow  the
                        tape to completely unload), thread the tape on
                        the tape drive and repeat step V.
                                                                Page 30
    OAD SAVASS BACKUP


          VI.  The terminal session now begins.

                    **NOTE 4**                                        
                        If  the  console  does not respond to anything
                        typed at the keyboard, do the following:

                        1.  Make sure the console is plugged into  the
                            system.  The connection should be inserted
                            into the right hand plug as you look  down
                            the back of the console from above.
                        2.  Check to see if the system is down.
                        3.  Turn the console off and then turn it back
                            on  (the  switch is located at the back of
                            the console).

                    **NOTE 5**                                        
                        If  a  '@'  or '!' prompt is the last entry on
                        the console when it is time to do the  backup,
                        type

                        KK (C.R.)

                        and proceed with the backup procedure.

                        'KK  (C.R.)'  need  not  be  typed because the
                        allfiles  (or  incremental)  backup   can   be
                        initiated  at  this  point.  The only commands
                        and responses in the backup  terminal  session
                        that  need  to  be  eliminated  are those that
                        follow:

                        1.  (CONTROL)-C
                        2.  OPER (PASSWORD) (C.R.)
                        3.  (C.R.)

                        The  first  command  of  the  allfiles  backup
                        terminal session would be

                        XDUMPER (C.R.)

          BYE.


          VII.  Push the ON LINE button and  then  the  REWIND  button
                (allow the tape to unload completely).

          VIII. Remove the tape from the tape drive, remove the  write
                ring  from the reel, label the tape reel appropriately
                and return it to the cabinet.

          IX.   Enter the appropriate information  into  the  OFFICE-4
                (OR  OFFICE-11) SYSTEM LOG (located next to the system
                console) and the OFFICE-4 (OR OFFICE-11) BACKUP LOG.
                                                                Page 32


          INCREMENTAL BACKUP


          I.   Check the density on the tape drive to make  sure  that
               it is set at 1600 BPI.

          II.  Select the appropriate incremental tape from  the  tape
               cabinet.   The  tape selected will either be a new tape
               (i.e., one that is not already a  part  of  the  backup
               library)  or  the oldest incremental tape in the backup
               library.

          III. Place a write ring (generally black or yellow)  in  the
               back of the tape reel.

          IV.  Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

          V.   Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape  reel  stops
               moving, then push the ON LINE button.

                    **NOTE 1**                                        
                        The  READ,  SELECT  and  WRITE  ENABLE  lights
                        should be lit.
                    **NOTE 2**                                        
                        The  small  light  near  the  read/write  head
                        should be shining on a silver metal  strip  on
                        the  tape  marking the beginning of the usable
                        portion of the tape.  The tape is now said  to
                        be at load point.

                        If the tape drive is unable to detect the load
                        point properly, gently tap the photocell (this
                        generally  clears  the  problem  up)  and  try
                        loading  the  tape  again.   Push  the ON LINE
                        button and then the REWIND button  (allow  the
                        tape to completely unload), thread the tape on
                        the tape drive and repeat step V.
                    **NOTE 3**                                        
                        If  the  operator  has  already  logged on the
                        system and has begun the backup  process,  all
                        of  the  above  steps  (I-V) must be completed
                        before 'TYPE MAG TAPE UNIT NUMBER:' appears on
                        the console.

          VI.  The terminal session now begins.

                    **NOTE 4**                                        
                        If  the  console  does not respond to anything
                        typed at the keyboard, do the following:

                            1.  Make sure the console is plugged  into
                                the  system.  The connection should be
                                inserted into the right hand  plug  as
                                you  look down the back of the console
                                from above.
                                                                Page 33

                            2.  Check to see if the system is down.
                            3.  Turn the console off and then turn  it
                                back  on (the switch is located at the
                                back of the console).

                    **NOTE 5**                                        
                        If  a  '@'  or '!' prompt is the last entry on
                        the console when it is time to do the  backup,
                        type

                        KK (C.R.)

                        and proceed with the backup procedure.
                    **NOTE 6**                                       
                        If there is some problem during the  execution
                        of  XDUMPER,  type "(CONTROL)-C" several times
                        and a '!' prompt  should  appear.   If  a  '@'
                        prompt appears instead, type

                        ENA (C.R.)

                        and the '!' prompt will appear.  There  is  no
                        need to save the tape(s) that has already been
                        written on because  a  change  bit  associated
                        with  a  file  is  not  reset until all of the
                        changed files have been dumped.

    OAD INCREMENTAL BACKUP


                        The following steps should be taken:

                        1.  Push the  ON  LINE  button  and  then  the
                            REWIND   button   (allow   the   tape   to
                            completely unload).
                        2.  Remove  the  tape  from  the  tape  drive,
                            remove  the  write  ring from the reel and
                            label the tape reel appropriately.
                        3.  Repeat steps II-IV.
                        4.  Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape
                            reel  stops  moving  and  then push the ON
                            LINE button.

                            **NOTE 12**                               
                                The  READ,  SELECT  and  WRITE  ENABLE
                                lights should be lit.
                            **NOTE 13**                               
                                The  small  light  near the read/write
                                head should be  shining  on  the  load
                                point.

                                If the tape drive is unable to  detect
                                the  load  point  properly, gently tap
                                the photocell (this  generally  clears
                                the  problem  up)  and try loading the
                                tape again.  Push the ON  LINE  button
                                and  then the REWIND button (allow the
                                tape to completely unload), thread the
                                tape on the tape drive and repeat step
                                4.

                    5.  Type   "MTA0:"   in    response    to    'Tape
                        device(MTAn:).   SDUMPER  will  then  list the
                        tape number.  The tape number will  correspond
                        to the tape's position in the backup set.

                    **NOTE 17**                                       
                        The directory file is created as the files are
                        being dumped;  therefore, the creation of  the
                        directory  file  is  not a separate process as
                        with the backup for system 930.

          VII.  Push the ON LINE button and  then  the  REWIND  button
                (allow the tape to unload completely).

          VIII. Remove the tape from the tape drive, remove the  write
                ring  from the reel, label the tape reel appropriately
                and return it to the cabinet.

          IX.   Enter the appropriate information  into  the  OFFICE-4
                SYSTEM  LOG  (OR OFFICE-11)(located next to the system
                console) and the OFFICE-4 (OR OFFICE-11) BACKUP LOG.

          ALLFILES BACKUP


              The full dump is the same as the incremental dump,  with
          the following changes:
          1.  Change   any   reference   to   INCRE-DUMP.ddmmmyy    to
              FULL-DUMP.ddmmmyy
          2.  Change INCREMENTAL <*>*.*;* to FULL <*>*.*;*

          BACKUP CHECK


              The following check can be made to make  sure  that  the
          backup went well:

              Check the  UTILITY  directory  to  make  sure  that  the
              directory   file   has   been   created   and   properly
              renamed in the statement         
              'REN...<UTILITY>INCRE-DUMP.DD-MMM-YY' or
              'REN...<UTILITY>FULL-DUMP.DD-MMM-YY'            
              (<UTILITY>INCRE-DUMP.DD-MMM-YY or
              <UTILITY>FULL-DUMP.DD-MMM-YY  is  the   directory   file
              name).

              i.e., At the '!' prompt the following can  be  typed  in
              order to get the UTILITY directory:

              DIR <UTI (ESCAPE KEY) (C.R.)

                                                                Page 39







          RESTORATION OF A SINGLE FILE


          I.   Check the density on the tape drive to make  sure  that
               it is set at 1600 BPI.

          II.  Select the appropriate  allfiles  or  incremental  tape
               (this  is  the  tape  on  which the desired file can be
               found) from the tape cabinet.

          III. Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

          IV.  Push the LOAD button, wait until the  tape  reel  stops
               moving, then push the ON LINE button.

                    **NOTE 1**                                        
                        The READ and SELECT lights should be lit.
                    **NOTE 2**                                        
                        The  small  light  near  the  read/write  head
                        should be shining on a silver metal  strip  on
                        the  tape  marking the beginning of the usable
                        portion of the tape.  The tape is now said  to
                        be at load point.

                        If the tape drive is unable to detect the load
                        point properly, gently tap the photocell (this
                        generally  clears  the  problem  up)  and  try
                        loading  the  tape  again.   Push  the ON LINE
                        button and then the REWIND button  (allow  the
                        tape to completely unload), thread the tape on
                        the tape drive and repeat step IV.
                    **NOTE 3**                                        
                        If  the  operator  has  already  logged on the
                        system and has begun the restoration  process,
                        all   of   the  above  steps  (I-IV)  must  be
                        completed before 'TYPE MAG TAPE UNIT  NUMBER:'
                        appears on the console.

          V.   The terminal session now begins.

                    **NOTE 4**                                        
                        If  the  console  does not respond to anything
                        typed at the keyboard, do the following:
                                                                Page 40

                        1.  Make sure the console is plugged into  the
                            system.  The connection should be inserted
                            into the right hand plug as you look  down
                            the back of the console from above.
                        2.  Check to see if the system is down.
                        3.  Turn the console off and then turn it back
                            on  (the  switch is located at the back of
                            the console).

                    **NOTE 5**                                        
                        If  a  '@'  or '!' prompt is the last entry on
                        the  console  when  it  is  time  to  do   the
                        restoration, type

          CONTROL CHARACTERS AND COMMANDS


          CONTROL CHARACTERS


          1.  Control-A deletes the previous character.
          2.  Control-C is equivalent to escape.
          3.  Control-T will display the load on the system  and  will
              not  interrupt  the  backup  process if typed during the
              execution of DUMPER.

              e.g., HALT AT 450054 LOAD 9.68 USED 0:00:10.8 IN 0:05:43



          COMMANDS


          1.  CD [user name] (C.R.)

              This command accesses the directory of the user named.

          2.  DIR [<user name>] (C.R.)

              This command lists  all  of  the  files  in  the  user's
              directory.

          3.  VD [<user name>] (C.R.)

              This command lists  all  of  the  files  in  the  user's
              directory along with some descriptive information (i.e.,
              number of pages, date written, date last  read,  author,
              etc.).  This is referred to as the verbose directory.

          4.  SY (C.R.)

              This command displays information about  the  status  of
              the system.

          5.  COPY [<user name>]file name (ESCAPE)...
              <ARCPRINTER>file name (C.R.) (C.R.)

              This command will copy the first file named to the  user
              name  ARCPRINTER  and  a  hard  copy of the file will be
              spooled off.
                                                                Page 43
    OAD CONTROL CHARACTERS AND COMMANDS


          6.  DEL file list (C.R.)

              This  command  creates  a  delete  list  containing  the
              file(s)  listed.   It  is best to specify the file name,
              extension and version of a file to  be  deleted  and  if
              more  than  one  file  is  listed,  the  files should be
              separated by a space.  It is alright if  the  file  list
              automatically overflows to following lines.

          7.  UNDEL file list (C.R.)

              This command removes the file(s) listed from the  delete
              list.   It  is  best to specify the file name, extension
              and version of a file to be removed and if more than one
              file  is  listed,  the  files  should  be separated by a
              space.  It is alright if  the  file  list  automatically
              overflows to following lines.

          8.  EXP (C.R.)

              This command  expunges  (deletes)  the  file(s)  on  the
              delete  list.  If a delete list is created but it is not
              expunged before logging out, the  file(s)  on  the  list
              will automatically be expunged upon logging out.

          9.  @DIR, (C.R.)                                 
              @@DE (C.R.)                                         
              @@ (C.R.)

              This series of commands lists the file(s) on the  delete
              list.

         10.  FREEZE (ESCAPE) (ESCAPE)

              This command enables the use of control-S and  control-Q
              for stopping and continuing info listed on the terminal.

         11.  ENA (C.R.)

              This command moves the user into the enabled  mode  ('!'
              prompt) where DUMPER can be run.

                    **NOTE 4**                                        
                        This  mode  gives the user a lot of power...BE
                        CAREFUL!

         12.  DIS (C.R.)

              This command moves the user from the enabled  mode  ('!'
              prompt)  to  the  disenabled mode ('@' prompt).  Use the
              disenabled mode whenever possible.
