 A copy of this manual (BCK.WRK) can be found on system 930 in (TSUCOOP),
along with the version of RUNOFF it was created in.  At the present time,
the same version of RUNOFF is in (UPL), and can be implemented by the command
GO#(UPL)RUNOFF.

SYSTEM 930 BACKUP PROCEDURES
.S 3
 SYSTEM 930
.S 2
 System 930 is on TYMNET. If you are on BUBBNET, you must go to TYMNET by
typing 'C' at the login prompt.
 At command level, you can be in either XEXEC mode or PDP mode. The prompt for
PDP mode is '.', while the prompt for XEXEC mode is '-'. The two modes are very
similar but there are differences in control characters. To delete a character
in PDP mode use backspace, in XEXEC use control-A. To delete a line, use 
contol-Q in XEXEC, control-U in PDP.
 The normal screen editor to use is PEAK. Manuals that may be of interest are:

is set at 1600 BPI.
 II.##Select the appropriate incremental tape from the tape
cabinet.  The tape selected will either be a new tape (i.e., one that is not
already a part of the backup library) or the oldest incremental tape in the
backup library.
 III.#Place a write ring (generally black or yellow) in the
back of the tape reel.
 IV.##Mount and thread the tape on the tape drive.

The READ, SELECT and WRITE ENABLE lights should be lit.
 **NOTE 2**########################################
The small light near the read/write head should be shining on a silver metal
strip on the tape marking the beginning of the usable portion of the tape.
The tape is now said to be at load point.

If the tape drive is unable to detect the load point properly, gently tap the
photocell (this generally clears up the problem) and try loading the tape
again.  Push the ON LINE button, then the REWIND button (allow the tape to
unload completely), thread the tape on the tape drive and repeat step V.
 **NOTE 3**########################################

 **NOTE 7**########################################
If there is a problem during the backup process, be sure to save the
tape(s) on which files were written before the problem occurred and label the
tape reel(s) appropriately.  The tape(s) needs to be saved because a change
bit associated with a file is reset as the file is stored and if the backup is
started again, the files stored during the first dump will not be stored
during the second dump (i.e., the files are lost).

DDMMDD refers to DAY OF WEEK-MONTH-DATE.  The DAY OF WEEK utilizes the first
two letters of the calendar day.  COF stands for Change Output File.
.S
e.g., TU0218.INC
 **NOTE **#########################################
When doing a directory for a full dump, the command should be of the form
.S
 *^&COF_ _SUMMDD.ALL#(C.R.)\&
.S
where MMDD is the date that the full dump was done on (the previous Sunday).
 **NOTE 20**#######################################
If a backup was dumped onto tape but a directory file was not created, TITO
can be instructed to create just a directory file.  It is not necessary that
the tape reel have a write ring when creating this file.  The terminal
session is the same as this one (step VI) except the following commands and
responses should be eliminated:
.S
.P 0,0
 NEW TAPE (C.R.)
 Y (C.R.)
 STORE ALL CHANGED (C.R.)
 REW (C.R.)
.S
The first command after entering TITO (when the '*' prompt first appears)
should be
.S
COF DDMMDD.INC (C.R.)
.S
The date in the name of the directory file (the file name is the 'DDMMDD.INC'
portion of the above command) should correspond to the date the backup was
dumped, not the date the directory file was created.
.S
NEW#FILE#^&(C.R.)\&
.P -4,0
 **NOTE 21**#######################################
It is important that this statement appears because it means that the file

 **NOTE 22**#######################################
At this point, we will create a file which will tell the location of each directory on the tape.
If the backup required more than one tape, the tapes should be remounted in
the same sequence in which they were written in order to create the directory
file.  When the directory has been completed for a tape and another has yet
to be mounted, the following message will appear:
.S
MOUNT NEXT TAPE##############################
CONTINUE ON DEVICE:
.S
The following steps should be taken:
.S
.LM 32
 1.##Push the ON LINE button, then the REWIND button (allow the tape to
unload completely).
 2.##Remove the tape from the tape drive and remove the write ring from the
reel if it had not already been removed prior to creating the directory file.
 3.##Mount and thread the next tape in the backup sequence on the tape drive.
 4.##Push the LOAD button, wait until the tape reel stops moving and then push
the ON LINE button.
.S
.LM 40
 **NOTE 23**#######################
The READ and SELECT lights should be lit.  The WRITE ENABLE light will be lit
if the tape reel has a write ring, but it will not be lit if the write ring
has been removed.
 **NOTE 24**#######################
The small light near the read/write head should be shining on the load point.
.S
If the tape drive is unable to detect the load point properly, gently tap the
photocell (this generally clears the problem up) and try loading the tape
again. Push the ON LINE button, then the REWIND button (allow the tape to
unload completely), thread the tape on the tape drive and repeat step 4.

.S
in response to 'CONTINUE ON DEVICE:'. The statement 'INPUT TAPE POS RANGE:'
will appear and then type "(C.R.)" in response to it.
.S
.LM 40
 **NOTE 25**#######################
If a file has been split between two tapes, the user name, file name and
starting block number in the message printed just before 'MOUNT NEXT
TAPE...CONTINUE ON DEVICE:...' should match the user name, file name and
starting block number in the message printed just after 'INPUT TAPE POS
RANGE:...'.  This is a good check to make sure the tapes have been mounted
in the proper order.  If a tape has been mounted in the wrong order, there
will be a message indicating this printed just after 'INPUT TAPE POS
RANGE:...'.
.S
.LM 32
 **NOTE **#################################
If there is a bad spot on the tape (i.e.- the tape is HUNG), hit <ctrl>C to
get out of TITO and close the file.  The file will be lost if it is not closed
immediately!
.S

Rewind the tape and continue by typing the following commmand:
.S
*dir all starting with (dir)file.ext
.S
If this doesn't work, the file the tape hung on may have to be skipped and the
directory continued with the next directory on the tape.

.LS
.LE
The number of files stored during the dump (the number of files stored is
given in the statement 'STORE COMPLETE,...FILES') should be the same as the
number of files processed while creating the directory file (the number of
files processed is given in the statement 'TOTAL...FILES PROCESSED.').
Occasionally the number of files processed is greater than the number of files
stored, but there is nothing to be alarmed about if this should happen.  If
the number of files processed is less than the number of files stored, report
this situation to an individual listed in the section CONTACTS.
.LE
Check the TSUCOOP directory for the directory file created (this is the
file created by the statement 'COF#DDMMDD.INC#(C.R.)' or
'COF#DDMMDD.ALL#(C.R.)', where DDMMDD.INC or DDMMDD.ALL is the directory file
name) and examine the information regarding this file.  Important information
to note is whether the file has actually been created and the number of pages
making up the file (the number of pages is typically greater than one).
.S
i.e., At the XEXEC level ('-' prompt) the following can be typed in order to
get the directory for a given file:
.S

Examine the terminal session printout for error messages appearing during
the actual dumping process and during the creation of the directory file.
Report these messages to an individual listed in the section CONTACTS.

recommended that if the operator is unfamiliar with the boot procedures
he/she should have an individual listed in the section CONTACTS demonstrate
these procedures.

.ST ####TOPS-20
 TOPS-20 is on TYMNET. If you are on BUBBNET, you must go to TYMNET by
typing 'C' when you log in. You must then log in again thru a port to 
reach the monitor. One way to do this is:
.S
 Please log in: ^&TSUCOOP:118;tymnetpassword\&
.S
 You then proceed to log in as described below for logging in at the console.
.S 2
CONTROL CHARACTERS
.S 2
 Two useful control characters to be aware of are control-U and control-W.
Control-U deletes the line just typed, and control-w deletes the word just
typed.  To delete a single character, use the delete or rubout key.
.S 2
COMMANDS
.S 2
 If you wish to type a comment, type a semicolon at the beginning of the line.
 When typing commands, typing an (ESCAPE) after part of the command will
complete the command for you.  A bell will ring if there are not enough
characters to make the command unique.
 The following are valid commands.  (A '?' at the '@' prompt will give the
following list.  A '?' after a given command (i.e. systat ?) will give you
the next alternative in the command.)
