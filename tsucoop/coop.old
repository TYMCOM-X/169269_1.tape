
USE OF THE TERMINAL

Much of the basic material is in the terminal owner's guide and the
XEXEC Reference Manual.  The terminal identifier for the HP 2621 is
"a" - if you are logging in over an engine.  If you are on NEXNET you
just do a carriage return.

Basic system to use is 930.  Co-op student is valid as TSUCOOP on 33,
36 and 118 as well.

Prompt character for XEXEC is "-", for PDP is ".".  To change from one
to the other type pdp or xexec.  The different modes have slightly
different commands; for example, <esc> gets you out of programs in
XEXEC, ^C in PDP.  Deleting is also different, as follows:

                        XEXEC            PDP

    DELETE CHARACTER     ^A          ^Q or backspace
    DELETE LINE          ^Q              ^U

The Tymcom-X Section almost all use PDP mode, the rest of the known
Tymcom-X world mostly uses XEXEC.

As a good rule, when in doubt on the terminal, in any of the various
programs, try typing "help" or "?"  and printing out the results.
Another thing to try is "<command>/?".  Sometimes there is also a "help
command.name" that gives further information.




EDITORS

There are three screen editors available.  Manuals are available for
TV-EDIT (ct1), VUE (ct4), and a guide for PEAK.
PEAK and VUE both have tutorials, which are in (SYSNEWS)PEAK.TUT 
and (SYSNEWS)VUE.TUT.
For line editor information, INFO on 930 has EDIT10 documentation,
Editor is in the XEXEC manual (and Editor manual).

TYMSHARE VG2

Coffee room has coffee, and hot water for tea.
There is a small refrigerator in the room next to conference room 5.


HARDCOPY:

SPOOL

For hardcopy you have a number of options.  Long listings can be SPOOLed
from one of the 10's.  You have to telecopy files from 930 for them to 
be spooled.  Information on SPOOL is in the manual.  A hack exists, 
(mpl)spool that will read a spool.def file in your directory so you don't
have to type the answers to all those prompts each time.  You can copy
someone else's and correct the necessary information.

Files can be spooled to CENTER on Bubb Road, and usually will be delivered
the next day.  Files can also be spooled to the print room in VG1 by
using node=1155 as an option.  They will be printed in the next day or
so depending on the load.  

All spool requests are picked up in the print room on the shelf that is
marked SYSTECH.

350

At present, the next best bet is to print out shorter files on the 350
in the graphics lab.  Log into it as you do normally (terminal
identifier is "a" as on the 444).  There is a manual by the 350.  

DIABLO PRINTER

For letter quality printing, use the Diablo.  There are two Diablo
printers in the room opposite Conference Room 1.  One is hard wired, to
use the other dial 6001, turn on printer and modum, insert phone when
high pitched tone is heard.  

The terminal identifier is "e".  To set margins, tabs, go LOCAL and
follow instructions on wall.  To see what you are typing more clearly,
set "Scroll" to on position.

(MPL)TYPE AND (PUB)UNDER

There are two good, useful printing programs on line, (mpl)type
and (pub)under.  Documentation and help files for (mpl)type are on
directory mpl, pub has a brief "help" text.  (pub)under is designed
to print out files created by the program pub--and is the only program
that will handle the underlining pub creates (control Xs) properly.
(pub)under will print a file, inserting form feeds (^l) before and
after.  Be sure to set "Top of Form" switch about three lines down
before running program.  Unfortunately (pub)under cannot handle tabs.
Under has the option of overstriking "n" number of times rather than
underlining; the switch for overstriking is /n.

COPYING FILES FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER

To copy a file from one system to another, either use telecopy (see
manual) or run (spl)copy.  Telecopy has the advantage of enabling
copying either to or from system you are in, and renaming files.

(spl)copy is primarily useful when copying a file to many systems.
It must be run from the directory from which the file is being copied
and requires ac license - if you are sending files to a directory other
than your own.

TEMP CORE

The program (sys)tc will display names of files in temp core. The
individual files can be listed by typing file name at the program prompt.

MAILBOX

To set up a mailbox, do the following:

.ctest setmai mail.box
.ctest makini

When you have set up a mailbox, all the mail you send or receive will
be saved in the file.  It can be read by the program MAIL.

At time of logon, or whenever you get a system level prompt, "mail
waiting" will alert to mail on system.  At prompt, type "mail" to
receive mail.

To send mail, type "send user name" and at the prompt "TYPE LETTER: "
type the text you want to send, ending with ^d.

To send to more than one person, type user names separated by ":".
Be sure to indicate in the mail you send that it is going to more than
one person (perhaps list them within the letter you are sending).
To send to a group of people regularly, you can list their user names
in a file and send "@ file name".  Again it is good practice to be 
sure recipients of the letter understand it is a group memo.

For information on the mailbox program type "r mail" and them at
the prompt "*" type "?".

To send contents of a file type "@ file name" following the 
prompt "TYPE LETTER: ".  A ^B will prompt for file name to include
at that point of the letter you are typing.

Command "postman" will review mail you have written and than has
not yet been received.  It will give you the opportunity to type
or cancel mail that has not been picked up.

USER NAMES

Within the section most use first names; Vivian and Greg their
last names (hiatt and matoka).  Two in the section (Mike, and Bill)
use initials (mch, wrs,).  The old convention was last name and first initial.

PROGRAM DIRECTORIES

There are library directories--mpl,spl,upl, "monitor program library"
(for section use), "system program library" (in house use), and "user
program library".  These contain useful programs and documentation.

WHOIS

There is a program (wrs)whois that will list employees of Tymshare
with their location and cost code.  You request a substring of the
name, or type "?" for more information on the program.

NONAME

To change any intial characteristics, run NONAME and then command
"CHA", which will list characteristics and prompt for changes.
DOCUMENTATION

Basic documentation on-line can be found in (*6news) for user programs,
(sysnews) for internal programs and by running info on 930 for monitor
and specific section documentation.  Documentation for hacks is rather
spotty--looking the directory where the program lives is a good first
start.

LICENSE

To set license on Tymcom-X you can give the command 

.o <license> <license><esc><oper password>

or

. o <license>...<license>
<oper name>

.<oper password>

There are groups of licenses that can be set; the group names are
"all" (which also can be set by o<esc>) which sets all your license,
and the following subgroups (you only get what you have):

"most"    RC OP SY GD TD JL AC RA WF
"some"    RC SY RA WF
"read"    RC SY RA

To disable license type "sete 0".  You can reduce a group of licenses
to one by "sete <license>" or "o <license>".

RUNNING PROGRAMS

The command "r <program>" will look on the directory (sys) for the program
with an extension .sav, .shr or .hgh.  To run a program on your directory
the command is "run <program>".
 
HACKS AND SUCH

There are some very useful hacks around.  One of the most userful is 
(spl) that will prompt for strings to search for and files to
look in.  It has some very nice features which you can get a brief list of 
by a ? to the "Search in:" prompt.  To exit the program the command is ".h".
WEEKLY SPOOL MAINTENANCE

Once a week, in the morning log in as sppoper on :36.

.r (mpl)mhx

hosts:@clean.cmd
commands:  
@clean        ;"clean.cmd" contains "run spfix <cr> clean <cr> pending <cr>
^D            ; quit <cr>"
record?y
file name: clean.rpt
detach: n

After it is completed run spmhx, file name clean.rpt (turn on printer for
pending information).  

Late in the afternoon, or the next morning:

.r (mpl)mhx
hosts:    ; host numbers of systems which were reported as having
          ; requests in PROC or TAPE states
commands:
run spfix
pend
quit
^D
record?n (turn on printer)

If the same job is still "stuck" in PRCO or TAPE state, log into that
system as sppoper, run spfix and charge off using command "charge".

NOTE:  If "charge" reports a record missing, continue anyway.  If it reports
differences in page counts, generally choose the maximum.

Give pend.rpt and list of old requests to SPOOL maintainer.
SPOOL MAINTENANCE

MONTHLY:

At end of month log into :36 and run an mhx job to all systems to do repair:

.r (mpl)mhx
hosts: @month.cmd
commands (end with control d)
run spfix
repair
compare
quit
spool   ; this is to check to see if spfix has renamed SPOOL back to sys
quit
^d
record?y
fepair.rpt
detach?n

Then run spmhx, file name repair.rpt, to get a list of systems on which
repair was not done (turn on printer).

Any systems that were not done can be done individually later.

NOTE:  If SPOOL cannot be run after running spfix on a system, the
message "SPOOL MAINTENANCE IN PROGRESS.  PLEASE TRY AGAIN IN 30
MINUTES" will be printed.  In that case log into that system as
sppoper, set all your license, check to see if there is an
(sppoper)spool.sav, and then rename as follows:

.rename (sppoper)fakspo.sav=(sys)spool.sav
.rename (sys)spool.sav=(sppoper)spool.sav

Inform the SPOOL maintainer about this!

It is normal to have all record reported bad by "repair" if SPOOL has
not been used.

ACCOUNTING FILE MAINTENANCE - MONTHLY

At end of month send an mhx job to run spfix, command "unproc" to check
for unprocessed bcharge and rcharg requests.  Charge off old requests--
or contact the appropriate office about them.

MONTHLY NODPRI AND PRIADR CHECK:

Every month, also run mhx and do cksums on nodpri and priadr, and
dir (this can be included in the end of month, or last day routines).  If
discrepencies are discovered, there are a couple of alternatives:

   1.  Just telecopy over the latest and most common copy to systems
       lacking it.

         This can be done using (mpl)copy.  At present it is a good
         idea to do the following first:

           
   2.  Run (sppoper)spnode on "odd" systems, and check differences with
       spnode on common systems.

   3.  Do procedure as follows to get new prinod:

          a.  log in to 8
          b.  set license
          c.  command copy
          d.  from file:  (spool)nodpri
          e.  to:  nodpri
          f.  command telecopy
          g.  mode receive binary fill=right
          h.  mode transmitt binary fill=right
          i.  (username)nodpri,:39
          j.  log into 39
          l.  run (sppoper)fixmap
          m.  file name nodpri
          n.  file out:  nodpri.out
          o.  r cksum on nodpri.out and (spool)nodpri
          p.  to find differences (if any)
              1)  if you haven't done so, run (sppoper)spnode, out file 
                  spnode.out
              2)  disable spool (when free)
              3)  rename (spool)nodpri to nodpri.bak (in case you have to
                   reverse yourself)
              4)  rename nodpri.out on your directory to (spool)nodpri
              5)  r (sppoper)spnode, out file spnode.new
              6)  differences, output to t, compare two files
          q.  then copy around latest version (if all right)  using (mpl) copy
          r.  be sure to check next day (using cksum, and an mhx job) to be
                sure everything got moved all right.

NOTE:

Printer and Node locations are maintained on system 8, and changed or
printed by program 1pnupd.  Validations maintains this data base:
person to contact is Gael Venn, x7081, in case of problems.
Time Sheet Procedures        February 1983                        Page 1


                       MTS TIME SHEET PROCEDURES                          



     Time sheets for the Tymcom-X  section are in a MAGNUM data  base on
system  36 under  user  tymxmts.  Individual  time sheets  are  in files
written  in  each user's  directory  by the  "generate"  command  in the
procedure  time.sheets and  loaded into  the data  base  when completed.
Projects and tasks  are added to  the lists by  the managers, or  can be
inserted  by  the  user  when  filling  out  the  time  sheet.   Further
information on preparing time sheets  can be found in "How to  Prepare a
MTS Time Sheet".

              WEEKLY LOADING AND GENERATING OF TIME SHEETS                    

     Every Monday (or the first working  day of the week if Monday  is a
holiday) all time sheets should be loaded at 1 p.m., and time sheets for
the next week should be generated.

     To  do  this log  into  36, set  write  files license,  and  gfd to
tymxmts.   Run  ftmagnum,  run  procedure  time.sheets.   The  procedure
time.sheets  has  four commands  other  than "help"  or  "quit":  "load"
(which can be "l"), "reload" (or "rel" or "r"), "generate" (or  "gen" or
"g"),

     and "status" (or "outstanding" or  "out" or "o" or "s").   You will
be using only the first three.

     The command "load all" will load all time sheets for "resources" in
the data base  who do not  have a termination  date entered.  If  a file
name is not given  following "all", the next  prompt will be for  a week
ending date, with the default to be used in brackets.  The  default date
will be the  date of the previous  Friday, and carriage return  will use
that date. If you want another date in the current year enter it  in the
format mmmdd as "apr05".

     To load  a single time  sheet the command  is "load  <resource id>"
where "resource id" is the first three letters of the first name and the
last initial of the person's name.  The file name can be included in the
command line as in "l loil apr05.tim"; this is the only way to  reload a
time sheet from the previous year as the program checks to see if a date
given is indeed  a Friday in  the current year  and if not,  changes the
date used to the following Friday.

     If there are  any errors, MAGNUM will  report them.  Any  line that
contains an error will not have the hours loaded.  Either edit  the file
and  correct the  error, or  send  mail with  the error  message  to the
originator of the time sheet and  ask them to correct the error  and let
you know so it can be reload.

     For each  time sheet loaded  a file "time.msg"  will be  written in
their directory reporting the number of hours reported.  MAGNUM will ask
if it is all right to create this new file with the question "New file -



                                   1
Time Sheet Procedures        February 1983                        Page 2


OK?" or "Existing  file - OK?".  In  either case, respond with  "yes" or
"y".  If any such files have been written, upon exiting  the time.sheets
command module, the file ts.cmd  will be written (again MAGNUM  will ask
if it all right to create the file) and a reminder will be given to send
mail  @ts.cmd.   In  this  case after  leaving  MAGNUM,  while  still in
directory (tymxmts), send mail @ts.cmd, message @time.msg.  If  any time
sheets are blank, a  message will be printed  at the end of  the loading
reporting the names of those  who have blank time sheets.  Send  mail to
the manager of anyone with a blank time sheet reporting that fact.

     After  loading  the  time  sheets,  issue  the  command   "gen  all
{filename}".  Again, if a file name is not given, there will be a prompt
for the date with the default  date given in brackets; in this  case the
default date will be the following Friday.  A carriage return  uses that
date, if you wish  another type it in.   If the time sheet  file already
exists,  another  file  called "mmmddx.tim"  will  be  written  into the
directory and a message will report that fact (and therefore you  do not
have to worry about overwriting a completed time sheet).

     After that, exit using the command "quit" or "q".

     When  someone  finishes  a  time  sheet  that  was  blank  when you
originally loaded them, load the new one individually using "load <re If
any  time sheets  are redone,  load them  individually.  The  command is
"load loil {filename}"; again a default date can be used.

                                REPORTS                                

     Many reports can be generated using the procedure mtx.   The report
routinely generated each week  is the pc70 personnel status  report.  To
produce this  report run  the procedure mtx.  Give the  command "pc70.rs
<date>" where <date> is the date of the last Saturday before  the report
date in the form  mm/dd/yy.  For example, if  the report is for  May 14,
the command would be "pc70.rs 5/8/82".  Have this report written  into a
file on your directory.  Exit  this module and then print two  copies of
the report on the 350.   Give one complete copy to the  section manager,
and give the unit  managers copies of their  time sheets and of  all the
people in their units.

     If  there are  any outstanding  time sheets  that get  done between
Monday at 2 and the  following afternoon, they should be  loaded Tuesday
afternoon and the pc70.rs report regenerated to the same file.

     Print out  another copy of  the report and  burst and give  to each
person (except  for the  managers).  If there  have been  changes, print
another copy of the whole report for the section manager.
