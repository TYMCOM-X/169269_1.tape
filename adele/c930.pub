In the midst of a very trying week, a number of section members made
a special effort to rebuild the file system on 930.

I would like to thank everyone who helped along the way.  There are
several people who deserve special mention.  Lois worked with ASP
trying to get a good dump and started the rebuild when the ASP restore
failed.  She followed that process through later making sure that
licenses were restored and also worked on a general cleanup of outdated
directories.  Carl
also worked on the ASP dump, verify, and restore, devoting considerable
time through Monday night and Tuesday morning.  Julie mounted "allfiles"
tapes Wednesday.  Darren supplied much needed consulting and help
starting the rebuild, and he also
restored all the incremental tapes.  Bill also supplied much needed
consulting and wrote the program which notified us of files
which were not restored from the incremental tapes.

To everyone, thanks again!  It's great to have 930 back.
