~~TOPS-20 Work~
.end;
.skip 2;

The following are needed for TOPS-20 as a development or internal
machine.  Requirements are greater for full center service.

~~Network File Transfer~.  It is needed now.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Status and suggestions~.  Darren Price and Scott Daniels are currently
trying to bring up a prototype as quickly as possible in order to test
the FTP specification and in response to Mike Nason's needs on the
SofTyme project.  We should build from their development results.

~~Software development work~.  Implement a prototype on TOPS-20 and TYMCOM-X
which is as close as reasonable to the FTP protocol developed by the
task force.  Interface a user-level front end.
.widen;

~~Tape File Transfer~.  MAGNUM needs a way to move large files (those
which will occupy more than one tape) from TYMCOM-X to TOPS-20.  MIS
may have other needs of similar scope later.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Software development work~.  Could make latest BACKUP work on TYMCOM-X
or port TITO to TOPS-20.  For MAGNUM's short term needs, the quickest
way is to write a TOPS-20 program to read TITO format tapes onto TOPS-20. 
To keep it simple, the program could be set up to write the files into
a single directory.  The fact that so many archive tapes are in TITO
format is reason enough to provide the ability to read TITO tapes on
TOPS-20.
.widen;

~~Listing Service~.  It's a given.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Suggestions~.  The existing printing facilities may be adequate as is
for internal needs.  A network printer should be considered, particularly
if we can't get dedicated printers for our TOPS-20 systems.

~~Procedures needed~.  Operator notification and delivery procedures.

~~Research~.  Network printing capability could be covered by an engine
work station which can talk to TOPS-20.  Contact someone (Jill Neidrauer?)
on that project.  If MIS is a possible user, talk to them about their
forms needs.  Decide whether or not existing printing capability is
sufficient.
.widen;

~~Validations~.  Although this can be informal, a routine needs to be
committed to paper.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Procedures needed~.  Need a procedure for requesting a validation,
approving it, and carrying it out.

~~Possible development work~.  A data base which relates
people and groups within the company to user accounts.  This data base
could generate the DLUSER ASCII file which could then be loaded on the
target system.
.widen;

~~Accounting~.  Need enough capability for problem tracking.  Need a
means to implement charge backs.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Recommendations~.  (1) Use class scheduling and existing TOPS-20 tools
to handle the charge-back problem of more than one internal group on a
machine; or (2) Implement a very stripped-down accounting mechanism
using information already collected by TOPS-20.

~~Software development work~.  Stream scanning tool.  Possible accounting
programs.
.widen;

~~Tape Handling~.  We need to work with operations to get procedures
committed to writing.  We need to take care to develop procedures which
are not too delicate (complicated to carry out).  I do not recommend
using archiving and migration features of TOPS-20 at the time; if we
can solve the problems inherent in using these features, they could be
introduced later.  Operations plans to use the existing tape library
software for tracking and bookkeepping purposes.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Procedures needed~.  Written procedures and schedules for daily
backups with DUMPER; written instructions for rebuilding a system from
scratch.

~~Software development work~.  Provide a means to load DUMPER
directories into a MAGNUM data base, so that recent backups can be
easily referenced for file retrievals, etc.
.widen;

~~Operator requests~.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Procedures needed~.  Notification procedures for requests to
operators for such things as saving files to tape, etc.

~~Software development work~.  An audit trail for "batch" requests and
a way to read that log.
.widen;

~~Software distribution~.  We need an interim plan and coordination with
software distribution to assure that long-range problems are handled.

~~SPR's~.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Procedures needed~.  An organized way to submit SPR's to DEC; a means
to insure that source updates or patches from DEC (or the section) get
installed and logged; crash analysis and logging procedures.

~~Possible development work~.  Extend ITSR data base to SPR's.  Means
to track updates and patches.
.widen;

~~Common Editor~.  A common editor (why not PEAK?) is highly desirable
as a development tool for those of us who will be switching among three
or more systems.

~~Product List~.  Needed ASAP.  What products will we commit to making
available?  Should we include products the division doesn't support?

~~Mail system~.  This is more of a future -- a mail system for the
division for 20's and VAX's.
.narrow 4,0;

~~Research~.  Look at AUGMENT's XMAILER system.  What would it take to
port it?
.widen;

~~Tools~.  Play by ear.  What are the greatest needs?  What can we
import?
