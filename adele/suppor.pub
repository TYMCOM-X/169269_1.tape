~~Support Line Goals~
.skip 2;
.List (-4,4,0,"1.");
.Item;
The TYMCOM-X Systems Software Support Line is intended to provide a
central place to contact the section for software help where time is
important but minutes are not of the essence (as they are for hotline 
calls).  
.Item;
It is also intended to provide a central initial contact point and
information resource for people who need to know how to initiate a
request for help with "routine" problems.  But for non-urgent situations
it is not intended to replace other ways of requesting assistance.  
.Item;
The support line is expected to help everyone in the section reduce the
number of interruptions they experience from outside the section by
providing a central focal point for incoming verbal requests.  
.Item;
The support line is expected to help the section get the right work
done by filtering out the trivial and unimportant requests and by
referring callers to other groups that can provide the same support
that we can or that should provide preliminary screening of problems
for us.  
.EndList;

~~Alternate Ways of Requesting Help~
.Skip 2;
.Item;
We will accept inquiries through the "normal" mail system by way of the
user name XCONSULT on systems 33, 38, 118, and 930.  For routine
requests from users who have access to one of these machines, this 
method should be encouraged.  Eventually, it will be helpful to have
a better and more extensive on-line system.
.apart;
.Item;
There is a written Project Request Procedure
for the division that has gone through a preliminary pilot stage.  It
is currently coming into use, and we will want most maintenance and
development requests to be initiated using it.  Forms, with instructions
for filling them out, will be available as part of the support line kit
for distribution to those who need them.

~~Staffing~
.Skip 2;
.Item;
The support line will be covered between the hours of 9AM and 5PM on
normal business days.  This time will be divided into two shifts, 9AM
to 1PM and 1PM to 5PM.
.apart;
.Item;
TSU, including the TSU manager will have the main responsibility for
staffing the support line.  Each member may take up to two four-hour
shifts per-week depending upon the involvement of the rest of the
section.
.Item;
Everyone outside of TSU will spend a half-day per month
answering the consulting line as a way of keeping all of us in touch
with the kind of calls we are getting and to provide some contact
with the rest of the company.  This requirement specifically includes
the section manager.  However, people outside of TSU who are on-call
around the clock for operating systems emergencies may be exempted
with the approval of their unit manager and the section manager.

~~Taking a Support Line Shift~
.skip 2;
.Item;
Everyone in the section is to refer any incoming calls
that are requests for technical assistance to the support line
for initial screening/handling.  
.apart;
.Item;
You will have a support line kit consisting of the following items.
.preface 0;
.List (-4,8,0,"a.");
.Item;
A telephone message pad.
.Item;
A current product list.
.Item;
A pad of ITSR forms (which we should all be using regardless).
.Item;
A referral list.  This is something that should grow with experience
and should be added to.
.Item;
A hot line schedule and call list.
.Item;
Project request forms.
.EndList;
To reduce confusion, there will be only two current message pads, which
I will keep on my desk in an obvious place.  When starting a shift, pick
up one of them.  Since four hours is a long time to stay near a phone,
find someone to back you up if you need to be away from your desk.
.preface 1;
.Item;
ALL calls to the support line are to be logged on phone message
slips.  Note the time, caller, their phone number, and a VERY brief
description of the reason for calling.  Also number the message in
sequence, add you initials, and give this number to the caller so he/she
can refer to it during a repeat call.  Write on the message the initials
of the person actually working on the problem if you must delegate
it.  Wherever
it is not clearly inappropriate, also fill out an ITSR and attach the
original phone slip to it.  Whoever notifies the caller of the completion
of the request should note on the message copy (in the book) when the
caller was notified and by whom.  If the call resulted in the generation
of a project request or other longer-term solution, note that as well.
.skip 1;
.continue;
This tracking will enable us to
watch for patterns (both with software and with callers),
insure that all requests get appropriate handling, especially those
that can't be completely taken care of in the course of the initial
phone call, and keep everyone who needs to know informed of what
is going on.  
.Item;
Try to answer whatever requests you can during your shift, and delegate
"fire-fighting" when necessary.  Try to stay in touch with what is
happening even if someone else is doing the work.  This will provide
good opportunities for cross-training, which will benefit all of us in
the long run.
.Item;
After taking a shift, you have the responsibility of making sure that
the right people hear about any significant calls.  For example,
the OSU manager is to be informed of any operating systems problems
that were reported, even if you took care of them yourself.  Similarly,
inform the appropriate people
for FORTRAN, SPOOL, and other products that get special
support.  
.Item;
We want the MAGNUM staff to get preferred treatment.  They should be
treated much more like members of the section than like outsiders.  
.Item;
Make referrals wherever possible, and unless it is clearly an emergency
situation, insist that problems receive proper screening from outside
the section before you accept responsibility for them.  This,
in itself, is an important service.  We
need to do it so that we can get our jobs done, but the caller may need
it because it's often very hard to find the group or person who can 
help.  Please jot down new information you come upon which can be added
to the referral list.
.Item;
The authorized callers are generally those who received the support line
announcement and others belonging to the groups named.  Operations has
been pretty cooperative in the past in limiting callers to the shift
supervisors.  In general, we will get calls from a member of one of the
"screening" organizations.  In general, calls from others should be
handled by making a referral to one of those organizations.  But
we don't want to carry this to an extreme.  If we can't
make an APPROPRIATE referral but do know enough to be able to help,
then treat the call as a request for consulting assistance; if more
than 10-15 minutes is
needed, the request should be reviewed by a manager
before going ahead.
.Item;
If we begin to have problems with too many people calling in who
should be going elsewhere for help, we will set up a list of
authorized callers and refuse calls from others.  
.Item;
The support line is to be kept free as much as possible.  It is only
to be used for outgoing calls in emergency situations where you have
a call on your private line already and can't reasonably ask the caller
to hang up.  If you can't complete a call in three (3) minutes, transfer
it to your private line.  
.Item;
If the message center answers the support line, return the call as soon
as possible and fill out a message slip at that time.
.Item;
Pick up the hot line if it rings, and treat it as the answering service
would.  It may be reasonable for us to get a BRIEF description of the
problem before contacting the first person on the call list.
.EndList;
