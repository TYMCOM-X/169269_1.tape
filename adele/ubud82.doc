     current problem or market opportunity:
       The current PERP/DEFER system is strained beyond capacity.  Some large
       customers, notably COEES, say they cannot depend on it.



     current procedure:
       Everyone does his/her best to cope with the situation.




     project objectives:
       The product is a TYMCOM-X resident PERP/DEFER system which appears to
       the user like the current 940 PERP/DEFER.  It would not allow users to
       submit jobs for systems other than the one on which the user is
       running, however.  It must include the means to bill users for
       PERP/DEFER jobs on the same basis as with the current system.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       The amount of maintenance required should eventually be reduced.  It
       takes regular clean-up to keep 940 PERP going, especially due to the
       overload on that system.  A TYMCOM-X resident system should make
       capabilities available to those who cannot depend on present system.

     qualitative benefits:
       Reducing the load on the 940 PERP system will remove a great deal of
       network traffic.

     risk:
       Implementation of PERP/DEFER billing on the TYMCOM-X may force
       solution of other problems such as accounting for frames and billing
       without knowledge of a node of origin.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       The solution to the billing problem will impact the monitor and MIS.

     proposed solution(s):
       Build the new PERP/DEFER around the newly-developed monitor features
       of PTY's and PCOM processor.

     alternative solution(s):
       Overhaul the current 940 PERP/DEFER system.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The current program (TITO) for archiving and system saves has many
       problems, is slow, and cannot handle files with "holes".  The lack of
       a "holey" file feature affects anyone with a large MAGNUM data base.
       TITO consumes system resources when it runs.  A full system rebuild is
       a lengthy procedure which results in files being restores which have
       been deleted in the interim.

     current procedure:
       Patience . . . The European APL users who deal with a great many files
       have a program which will compress files after they are restored.  Due
       to space limitations, they must sometimes go through several rounds of
       restoring and compressing files when they need files from tape.

     project objectives:
       A new program (SNARL) to replace the existing TITO and a companion
       maintenance program (DSNARL) to assist in tape recovery.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Completion of SNARL, which uses paged disk I/O should allow somewhat
       faster operation.  Since a STORE of changed files is done nightly, and
       a STORE of all the files is currently done once a week, even a small
       improvement in performance can have substantial benefit.
       Implementation of a different algorithm for system rebuilds, one which
       does not cause deleted files to be restored could reduce the rebuild
       time by reducing the number of files which must be transferred and by
       eliminating stops and starts needed to acquire additional disk space.
       Also, the tape format of SNARL will be less wasteful of tape.

     qualitative benefits:
       Handling for files with "holes" will enable full monitor use of that
       feature.

     risk:
       There is a possibility of confusion in implementing new operations
       procedures.  Although we expect performance improvements, it may not
       be substantial, due to the necessary disk-bound nature of the data
       transfers.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       It will change operations procedures somewhat.  There have been a few
       monitor effects, to date, and monitor impact is still a possibility.

     proposed solution(s):
       There has been a proposed solution in terms of a design for SNARL that
       was, in the past, approved.  Considerable effort and accomplishments
       have been made on the project.  However it has not received full-time
       support, with the exception of a two-month period of time in 1980.

     alternative solution(s):
       Modify TITO or forget the problem.  But beware!  TITO has a large,
       ouding backlog of problems already and is extremely difficult to
       work with.  It is an old program.  And the problems will not go away.
       They will become more critical.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The SPOOL/BATCH system of programs requires time-consuming, regular
       preventative maintenance in order to keep it running.  SPOOL in
       particular is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enhance.
       Some of its functions, such as the completion of requests moved to
       tape for printing on a different system, the notification of operators
       of requests to be printed, and the propagation of the system and
       center maps needed by SPOOL depend upon programs running in (PJ) and
       auxiliary circuits.  When these fail, the result is long turn-around
       times for the completion of users' requests and complaints.
       Modifications to SPOOL to handle three and four-digit system numbers                                        
       is inevitable.  This is a major change to SPOOL which may not be
       feasible with the present code.

     current procedure:
       A TSU person spends 10-20% of total time fighting "fires" and
       maintaining SPOOL.

     project objectives:
       Initially, an investigation should be done which will result in a
       proposal for a new design of SPOOL.  This should include a complete
       survey of the current system and its problems from the standpoint of
       end users, "remote" and "center" operators, links to the accounting
       files and impact upon MIS software, and new network features (such as
       local networks).

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       The payoff in revenues would come if a new tool can be successfully
       implemented.  The study is necessary in order to assure an adequate
       design.

     qualitative benefits:
       Eventual elimination of the laborious maintenance would improve
       morale.

     risk:
       There should be little risk in an investigation.  A project to
       implement would be a major one.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       Impacts MIS.  Also impacts users who access SPOOL in a non-interactive
       manner, such as from MAGNUM, FORTRAN, or command files.  This could be
       a potentially large impact but could and should be overcome.  The
       present interface to SPOOL is cumbersome and inflexible, and we could
       make this feature much more reliable.

     proposed solution(s):
       This is not clear at this time.  However, assign a person or task
       force to do the study.  A TYMCOM-X person should be in charge, and the
       study should end with a proposal and a high-level, preliminary design
       for the product.

     alternative solution(s):

       Limp along with present SPOOL until everyone becomes exasperated, or
       work on ways to overhaul the present system or parts of it.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       In the long term, TELECOPY will not be fixable.  It can already been
       worked on by many different people; there is no consistency to it; it
       has been proved to be very difficult to enhance.  It is difficult to
       use from command files, and it is increasingly being used this way.

     current procedure:

     project objectives:
       A new file transfer product which can operate more as a tool around
       which other circuit-dependent programs can be built.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Unclear at this time.

     qualitative benefits:
       A good TELECOPY could save the duplication of effort that occurs in
       building special purpose transfer tools.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Time the design of this product to coincide with the release of a
       protocol recommendation from the FTP task force which can be used.
       Design a new interface to TELECOPY and consider reasonable means to
       run the program from command files or in a frame.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave as is.
