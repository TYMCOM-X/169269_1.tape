TOPS/20 UTILITIES and SUPPORT PLANNING
.skip 3;
.L1
Strategies
.L2
Short range
.L3
Encourage use of TOPS/20 by the section.
.L3
Help provide a good development environment on internal TOPS/20 systems.
.L2
Medium range
.L3
Provide the minimum functionality necessary to support a beta test
site, probably a small, dedicated system.  This is a vague strategy,
because it is dependent upon the customers needs.
.L3
Support responsibilities should be defined.
.L3
A feedback machanism should be implemented.
.L2
Long range
.L3
Provide the functionality necessary to support a time-sharing
environment under TOPS/20.
.L3
Provide the software maintenance needed to support a potentially large
customer base on TOPS/20.
.L1
Strategy issues
.L2
Emphasis should be on short and long range strategies, since the medium
range needs are not clear.
.L2
Necessary product development should stress usable milestones.
.L2
Determine priorities of major utilities products.
.L1
Major Utilities Products
.L2
Periodic processing capability (PERP)
.L2
Printing, including remote capability (SPOOL)
.L3
Known requirements
.L4
Provide remote site (district office) printing capability
.L4
Provide a similar level of formatting and forms capability as we
have at present on TYMCOM-X.
.L4
Report necessary statistics for user invoicing.
.L4
Provide support for an engine work station interface.
.L5
Efficient use of network resources for multiple copies -- eliminate
need to transfer each copy through the network.
.L5
Allow accurate and up-to-date status reporting to users.
.L5
Provide a good interface for intelligent remote sites, other than
printers.
.L3
Design issues
.L4
Should SPOOL handle hosts without printers?  If so, how?
.L4
Need a solution or a work-around for the high-numbered host problem.
.L4
Should charging responsibility for SPOOL postage (RCHARG) be removed
from operators or at least district office operators?
.L5
Could postage be billed automatically?
.L5
Could billing statistics go directly to the stream?
