.list (-4,4,0,"1.");
.item;
During 1st quarter 1983, I will learn and carry out the following
tasks:
.list (-4,4,0,"a.");
.item;
Distribution of COEES XCONSULT mail.
.item;
Handling and follow through on general support questions which arrive
as XCONSULT mail.  (This objective proved to be unrealistic and is not
rated.)
.item;
Bringing up the lab systems when necessary.
.item;
Performing monthly SPOOL checking and follow-through.
.endlist;
.item;
At the beginning of a project, write a plan for getting started.  This
will probably consist of a statement of objectives and a list of
questions which need to be answered.
.item;
I will summarize in writing the tests performed to check out a completed
program.  (This was done for easily "measurable" output.  For the DUMPER
and DLUSER data bases, discussions took the place of a written summary.)
.item;
Finish and release the DUSAGE program.
.item;
Design and implement the schema and programs needed to keep a data base
of the current sets of DUMPER backup tapes for a TOPS-20 system.
.item;
Implement a DLUSER data base on TOPS-20.
.endlist;
.skip 2;

~~Personal Objectives~

.list (-4,4,0,"1.");
.item;
Learn the use of at least two new programming tools per month.
.item;
I will increase my programming experience, particularly with respect
to data structures, by implementing a series of small programs, the
specifications of which will be worked out with my manager.  The first
one will be an application for a stack.  (Two such projects were
accomplished.)
