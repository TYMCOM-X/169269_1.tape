TO:     Members of the Long Range Planning Committee

RE:     Minutes of November meeting




     The Long Range Planning Committee of the Peninsula Chapter of the
ACM met at the chapter "office" (1901 Old Middlefield Way, Mountain
View) on June 23, 1983 for the quarterly meeting.  The attendance list
and discussion topics follow.

Attendees:      Fred Brand
                Fred Delvey
                Dorris Miller
                Adele Newman
                Jan Matser
                Bob Van Tuyl
                Lew Bornmann
                Len Coleman
                Mary Fowler
                Bob Haas
                Joanne Stewart

     Policy Manual:  Lew Bornmann brought a limited number of copies of      
the latest version.  There was a brief discussion of the nature of the
changes, which were mainly wording.  All available information that had
been provided by the committee was included.  The following suggestions
were agreed upon.
o  Prepare about 30 copies for the chapter for officers and committees.
   Most of these could be distributed at an upcoming meeting called by
   Karen Chez.
o  Deliver a copy to the Golden Gate Chapter.
o  Urge the chapter to appoint a person or committee responsible for
   keeping the manual up to date.  axf o  Announce the availability of
   the manual with an article in the Bit Dropper.

     Publications Guidelines:  At Bob Van Tuyl's request, the LRPC began      
discussion of publications guidelines with the objective of formulating
a policy that the council can approve and the chapter can live with.
The guidelines (attached) which were approved by the Committee on
Chapters is a reasonable beginning.

     The discussion began with a history of the events leading up to the
guidelines.  What follows is a brief summary.  A series of letters which
were written by Jan Matser and which were critical of national ACM
appeared in the Bit Dropper during the spring.  These were brought to
David Brandin's attention; word was passed to Stu Zweben who, in turn,
asked Dahl Gerberich to look into the matter.  Steven Zilles was also
somehow involved.  Bob Van Tuyl prepared to go to NCC with a proposal
for publications guidelines amid a good deal of unpleasantness, which
included threats to him to remove the council of the Peninsula Chapter.
At NCC, the subject came up at the Chapters' Forum, the Chapter

                                                            July 8, 1983


Chairman's meeting, the Committee on Chapters meeting, and it was
mentioned at the Chapters' Board.  In the Chapter Chairmen's meeting,
the "policy" was passed (recommended).  The Committee on Chapters passed
a motion to make the "policy" a "guideline".  (See the attachment).

     The LRPC discussion continued with an airing of current problems
and suggestions.  In general, the consensus was that a clear statement
of purpose for the Bit Dropper should be available to the editor in a
form which can easily be passed along to new editor when responsibility
changes.  The suggestions are summarized as follows (with some editorial
comment).
o  Provide a clear policy statement for the Bit Dropper which should
   state who the editor works for.  (Len Coleman).
o  Allow some flexibility of purpose for the Bit Dropper.  Clearly some
   features are extras, while others (the meeting announcements for
   example) are musts.  Depending upon chapter priorities, budgets, and
   editors, the contents may need to vary.  The following list in order
   of importance is suggested:  (a) meeting notices, (b) officer lists,
   etc., (c) calendar, (d) other.  (Fred Brand).
o  Consider making the position of editor a paid one.  (Jan Matser,
   Adele Newman).
o  Solicit opinions of past Bit Dropper editors.

     Since time is important, I suggested that the next meeting be held
very soon rather than waiting the usual three months (or more).  We
decided on a meeting date of Thursday, July 7, 1983.

     Bit Dropper Advertising:  Bill Reiken is seeking advertising in the       
Bit Dropper.  Karen Chez would like to see the issue re-clarified.  The
committee needs to consider this issue along with other publications
issues.  A guideline is needed.  Advantages and disadvantages need to be
thought about.  Someone made the suggestion that non-profit
organizations be distinguished from the others in ads, if they are
accepted.

     Other:  Lew Bornmann asked for a description of the Long Range     
Planning Committee for the Chapter Manual.
