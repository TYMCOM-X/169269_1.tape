		PDP-10 LUD FORMAT

The LUD file [(SYS)LUD.SYS] consists of 887  normal
blocks, numbered 1 to 887 and any number of overflow blocks.
The format description starts at the begining of the block
specified by a hash locater generated from the user name.
This format is reapeated as necessary.

When an entry is deleted, the space is not necessarily reclaimed
immediately. An empty entry will be indicated by a hashed
user name (word 4) or 0.

WORD 0: Project-Programmer number. Same as Global Account Number
	in left half, Universal User Number in right half.
	If the word is 0, it is the end of the block and there
	are no more overflow blocks for this hash locater.
	If the word is negative, the right half contains the
	block number of the next overflow block for this hash
	locater.

WORD 1:	Bits 28-35 (377) District number

WORD 2:	BIT 0 User may NOT login under this name
	BIT 1 User should NOT recieve the 'TYMSHARE' message
	BIT 2 Resticted bit
	BIT 3 Anyone in this GAN can GFD here
	BIT 4 TRU budget word present
	BIT 5 Do NOT allow ATTACH during login
	BIT 6 Force ATTACH at login (If any DET jobs)
	BIT 7 Do NOT allow multiple jobs this UUN
	BIT 8 Do NOT require PROJECT CODE
	BITS 9-20 Unused
	BITS 21-26 Indicate broadcast LETTER not yet recieved
	 by this user. Bit 26 indicates broadcast letter 1.
	BIT 27 (400) Indicates there is a program to be run
	 automatically for this user when he logs in.
	BIT 28 Unused
	BITS 29-35 (177) Size of this entry in words.

WORD 3:	Privilege bits
	BITS 0-1 (600000) Language bits.
	BIT 2 (100000) This user should be switched to
	 daylight savings time at appropriate time.
	BITS 3-7 (76000) Number of hours displacement from
	 GMT which should be applied for this user.
	  A zero value in this field is interpreted as PACIFIC zone.
	  All other values are inerpreted as a four bit displacement
	  from GMT.  If bit 3 (40000) is ON, the displacement is
	  positive, if bit 3 is OFF, the displacement is negative.
	BITS 8-10 Unused
	BITS 11-17 Settable amount of core this user can access.
	 This should be set to same number as bits 29-35.
	BIT 18 Reserved for use by MONITOR, ignored in this field.
	BIT 19-20 One of
		0 - LOGOUT ON DISCONNECT

		1 - DETACH ON DISCONNECT
		2 - CONTINUE ON DISCONNECT
		3 - DETACH ON DISCONNECT - TIMEOUT
	BIT 21 (40000) Tymshare proprietary
	BIT 22 (20000) Account supervisor
	BIT 23 Used by MONITOR (for Mail waiting)
	BIT 24 Used by MONITOR. Ignored in this field.
	BIT 25 (2000) Set by LOGIN from bit 4 of word 2 TRU control
	BIT 26 Unused
	BITS 27-28 Mode user is running in
	   0 PDP-10 MODE
	   1 TYMEX (940) MODE
	   2 GE MODE
	   3 SUDS MODE
	BITS 29-35 Amount of memory user is allowed to have.
	 This number has 1 added to it and is then multiplied by
	 2 to determine number of K of memory allowed. This
	 number is subject to a MINIMUM in the MONITOR and a
	 maximum imposed by PHYSICAL memory size.

WORD 4:	Hashed user name

WORD 5:	TRU budget (possibly not present)

WORD 6A:Name of program to run (this word and the 2 following it
	 are present only if word 2 indicates that there is
	 such a program.

WORD 7A:First half of user name of program to run.
WORD 10A:Second half of user name (in sixbit).

WORD 6:	(OR 11) BITS 0-23 Name of file structure.
	BITS 24-35 Flag bits for file structure.
	  BIT 24 Structure READ ONLY for this user.
	  BIT 25 Do NOT create new files in this structure.
	  BITS 26-35 Undefined

WORD 7:	Logged in QUOTA (in BLOCKS)

WORD 10:Logged out QUOTA (in BLOCKS)

These three words are repeated for each structure the user can
access. The number of repeats may be determined from the size
field in word 2.

		Hash Subroutine

Routine takes a 12 character user name (SIXBIT) in T1 and T2.
It uses accumulators T3,T4,A,B,C,D, and E. T1 and T2 must be
consecutive. T3 and T4 must be consecutive. C,D, and E must
be consecutive. The routine returns the hashed user name in T1
and the block number (hash locater) in T2.
