     feasibility of proposed project:
             Implementing new  commands of any  significance in  the existing
     SPOOL  is extremely  dangerous,  and I  do  not recommend  it.   We have
     experienced good  examples of the  difficulties recently when  trying to
     repair long-standing paging and  format problems which, on  the surface,
     looked straightforward.
             A new  slave program (suggestion  "1" from the  project request)
     which would manipulate and transmit information from SPOOL's  data bases
     and would alter the  request status accordingly would need  to cooperate
     with SPOOL in the use of  its files and status data.  The  SPOOL changes
     would probably  be tricky and  widespread due to  the way that  SPOOL is
     written (I could discuss the reasons at great length).  In  addition, we
     often experience  SPOOL data  base problems now,  which are  solved when
     they  occur by  the use  of the  maintenance program  SPFIX.   These are
     likely to be  complicated by the  addition of another  program accessing
     SPOOL's files.
             In   consideration   of  these   difficulties,   my  preliminary
     suggestion for a solution in  conjunction with the existing SPOOL  is as
     follows:  (1) Implement a new status code in SPOOL for files  being sent
     to the  remote station.  SPOOL  must be taught  to leave  these requests
     alone.  (2) Implement the means to identify and mark with the new status
     the requests which will be transferred.  This could be done with a slave
     program  running   independently  or  by   a  combination  of   a  SPOOL
     modification  and  and engine  program  logged into  SPOOL.   The STATUS
     command could be scanned (hopefully licenses won't be a problem) to find
     the requests, and a  new command in SPOOL could  be used to set  the new
     status on the request.  The  new command would be analogous to  the HOLD
     command.   Other variations  are possible,  such as  a slave  which only
     reads SPOOL  data bases and  uses SPOOL to  make a  status modification.
     (3) Implement a means of changing the request status to  COMP (complete)
     when the files have been printed.  There are several possibilities.  One
     is to use  the existing mechanism for  marking finished "print  to tape"
     requests as complete.   Others are a new  command in SPOOL or  data base
     alterations done by the slave program.
             Implementing a scheme such  as suggestion "2" is  most desirable
     in a rewrite  of SPOOL.  In  fact, it should  be made general  enough by
     means of applying various modules for collecting the data such  that the
     solution may  cover other  applications as well.   Some of  the existing
     ones  are  the use  of  SPOOL by  MAGNUM,  the current  "print  to tape"
     capability, and the DCS stations.

     recommended alternative:
             At this time,  it is necessary to  run SPOOL over a  circuit and
     collect the files as they would normally be printed.  In order  to avoid
     the transmission of  multiple copies the  following could be  done. Scan
     the output from the status and list commands to obtain information about
     requests.   The list  command gives  each file  name and  the  number of
     copies  desired  for  it.   Then  use  the  print  option  which  allows
     individual files  to be  printed.  (IMPORTANT) There  is a  problem with
     this in that  this particular print option  does not make  an accounting
     record; this would otherwise need to be done.

     technology requirements:
          Existing TYMCOM-X tools for SPOOL work.

     benefits/justification:
             A  good   general  solution  to   this  problem   would  satisfy
     implementation  requirements for  what seems  to be  a growing  need for
     access to SPOOL by local and remote applications.

     impact on other systems:
             Modifications  to existing  SPOOL should  affect  SPOOL software
     only.   A  rewrite should  take  into account  the  combined BATCH/SPOOL
     system and associated accounting and would affect MIS.

     risk analysis:
             The risk of modification is the introduction of new problems and
     the time and cost to fix them.

     PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES:  (in weeks)
             NOTE:  The  estimates are based  upon modifications  to existing
     SPOOL and  take into account  the difficult nature  of doing  so.  These
     include time for modifiying the maintenance program SPFIX, which must be
     kept  up to  date.  Adding  such features  to a  rewrite  would probably
     increase the project  time by about  6 weeks.  The  on-going maintenance
     time for SPOOL is likely to be increased if enhancements are made to the
     existing system.  The amount is unknown at this time.
