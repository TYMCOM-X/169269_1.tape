             The following procedures should be helpful during the transition
     from one set of officers to the next.

     1.  The terms of the committee chairpeople can overlap by several months
         into the succeeding term.  Traditionally the program chair plans for
         events through the September meeting so that the next person has
         several months lead time for the arrangment of the first events to
         follow.

     2.  For several years, the final council meeting of the term has been a
         transition meeting with both councils and the regional
         representative invited.  They have been held independently of the
         final dinner meeting on an informal basis (such as a cookout).
         Removing the one-hour time constraint which is the norm at monthly
         meetings is important.  In addition, this frees the final dinner
         meeting (traditionally the annual winery meeting) from schedule
         pressures; everyone can attend an enjoy!

     3.  The out-going chairman should meet with the in-coming chairman to
         give a status report.  It may be helpful to have this report in
         writing.  At that time, any outstanding business can be discussed
         and plans made for resolving it.  The committee chairs should be
         encouraged to do the same.

     4.  Check list for the out-going chairman.
                 * Put together material for archiving.  The same item
                   applies to committee chairpeople also.
                 * Select the audit committee.
                 * Get the gavel imprinted (in time for the final meeting).
                 * Make sure the inventory list of properties is up to date.
                 * Notify the following people of the new officers:  (1) the
                   regional representative, (2) the Golden Gate Chapter
                   chairman, (3) the Bit Dropper editor.

     5.  There are two special suggestions for the in-coming chairman.
         First, start immediately upon election to select the new committee
         chairpeople.  Second, take advantage of the resources of the Long
         Range Planning Committee.  Advising the chapter chairman is one of
         its major functions.
