     ** Project funded through marketing
      + more time to go


     NOTE:  The following manpower assumptions were made:
             (1) Calstate student added to TSU in January.
             (2) Transfer of Dave Smith to Languages in January.
             (3) Additional TSU person (5/1/82).



                         TSU UNIT -- ON-GOING ACTIVITIES




     General SPOOL maintenance:  This  is time spent in  regular preventative
     maintenance as  well as problem  analysis and occasional  emergency data
     base fixes.  It currently requires 10-20% of a person's time  to perform
     these tasks.  The work is  necessary in order to keep SPOOL  running and
     bringing in revenue.  Maintenance during early 4Q81 has  been abnormally
     high;  thus I  have put  a large  estimate of  time for  for  4Q81.  The
     allocation summary also shows an increase in maintenance toward  the end
     of 1982.  This is  a reflection of the  result of an increasing  load on
     SPOOL and an increase in the number of systems running SPOOL.

     General PERP  maintenance:  This is  time spent in  regular preventative
     maintenance as  well as problem  analysis and occasional  emergency data
     base fixes.  Operations and  marketing support have assisted  where they
     can with  some of  the PERP work.   Although Mike  Hinckley has  had the
     ultimate responsibility for this to the present time, we expect to shift
     the task to TSU as soon  as reasonably possible.  The amount of  work is
     also expected to increase toward the end of 1982 until the completion of
     a X-PERP system which can alleviate the overloading of the  current 940-
     PERP.

     Misc. IX and X maintenance:  Time spent in unscheduled support of any IX
     and X  software for which  the group is  responsible.  Much of  the work
     staffing the "support line" will be reported in this category.

     Misc. monitor  maintenance:  This  will include  monitor configurations,
     quick bug fixes, miscellaneous small projects not significant  enough to
     report elsewhere.  Will  also take into  account the assistance,  by one
     TSU  person, the  staffing of  the  "hot line".   This type  of  work is
     justifiable for  training purposes and  for assisting the  monitor group
     with a growing support  responsibility.  The time estimate  accounts for
     two people at 4 hours per week each.

     General consulting:  TSU is attempting to take as much of  the section's
     consulting load as  it can.  TSU expect  to develop the  information and
     expertise to make referrals as much as possible.  The aim is  to provide
     selective, quality consulting.

     Learning  &  teaching:   People  need  some  learning  time  to  develop
     technically and  stay current with  new developments.  Teaching  time is
     expected  to  be minimal,  but  is a  possibility.   (The  time estimate
     increases by .04 for each additional person.)

     Unit  management:  The  amount of  time expected  for 4Q81  and  1Q82 is
     higher than for subsequent  quarters due to such activities  as budgets,
     implementation  of  project  request  procedures,  installation  of  the
     support and hot  lines, and the fact  that one manager is  covering both
     the  TSU and  utilities areas.   This is  expected to  decrease somewhat
     after a utilities unit manager is in place.



     Miscellaneous non-project time:  administrative meetings, clerical, lost
     time, equipment down, miscellaneous non-development.  (The time estimate
     increases by about .05 for each additional person.)

     Time  off:   Vacation (2  weeks  each,  Adele -  3  weeks),  9 holidays,
     personal  and  medical (estimated  at  1 day  per  year).   Personal and
     medical time is estimated very  low, since this is largely made  up with
     flexible work time.  (This estimate increases by .08 for each additional
     person in the unit.)

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Work is needed on an on-going basis to keep individually contributed
       systems tools documented and available for use.



     current procedure:
       At present, things are ad hoc.  In order to find and use the tools,
       one must do some searching or ask around.  We have many useful
       programs in the section's directories without documentation.


     project objectives:
       Performing this on-going task depend upon completion of a project to
       organize the system hacks we already have.  After doing such a
       project, we do not want to slip back into the old, ad hoc ways of
       doing things.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       The easy availability of tools improves programmer productivity.

     qualitative benefits:
       Reduction of frustration level.




     risk:



     impact on other systems (include accounting):



     proposed solution(s):
       Assign a TSU person the on-going responsibility.




     alternative solution(s):
       Leave things as is.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Work is needed on an on-going basis to keep our section library up to
       date.  The materials involved are manuals, documentation, and program
       archives.  The tasks involved are short documentation projects,
       filing, and possibly some data base design and entry.

     current procedure:
       A project is in progress to organize the materials we have to-date.

     project objectives:
       Make sure we don't lose the benefit of the current organization
       project by allowing additions to our library to remain unaccounted
       for.

       Reduction of frustration level.

     risk:

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The district/cost code conversion now underway causes serious problems
       for BATCH, PERP, and SPOOL support for our European affiliates.  Most
       of the programs involved check district numbers to identify European
       customers and sometimes to divide them into separate groups.  E.g.,
       BATCH requests submitted by CEGI and SLIGOS customers are routed into
       special files for translation and resubmission, and there are
       differences in billing for tape stores/restores among affiliates.
       Proper time for DEFER rates is established by routine European PERP
       jobs to the master on 14 which is connected to a Tymbase set to
       European time.

     current procedure:
       Use district number to identify customers requiring special BATCH or
       PERP handling.

     project objectives:
       Correct the programs which are affected by the accounting file
       changes.  The best way to solve this problem is unclear.  The 940's
       could be especially difficult.  (Please see (adele:930)invest.doc for
       further discussion of this problem.) Most of the changes we previously
       thought were necessary for the programs which use the BATCH accounting
       files will not be needed, since the PPN's are provided and the
       appropriate cost code can be looked up by the accounting programs.
       However some changes will be necessary if the district is either
       blanked or eliminated from the accounting files.  Potentially all the
       programs that are part of BATCH/SPOOL would be affected:  BATCH,
       SPOOL, BCHARG, RCHARG, 370CHG, (*1BATCH)RBCHG, LISTER, 1CLEAR, RECPPR,
       SPFIX, and TAPCHG.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Work will be needed to preserve existing pricing schemes, to provide
       acceptable BATCH service to French-speaking customers working on
       systems location in U.S. centers, and to allow CEGI and SLIGOS each to
       translate requests for their own customers.

     qualitative benefits:
       None.

     risk:
       The risk is dependent upon the solution chosen.  In general, modifying
       old software, some of it written in SIMPL, presents a challenge.  It
       is risky to modify so many pieces of software, all with
       interdependencies.  Any misunderstanding of the use of the batch
       accounting files could cause a problem.  See also
       (adele:930)invest.doc for a thorough discussion of risks.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       We are impacted by accounting an MIS.  We must cooperate with them on
       a solution.

     proposed solution(s):
       Not clear at this time.

     alternative solution(s):
       Ask the affiliates to give up the special services currently provided
       to them and their customers.  This minimizes the extent of the
       changes.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       There is currently no acceptable way to enter special handling charges
       into the "batch" charging files for later processing by MIS.  Users
       are billed a charge for shipping or receiving of items to/from our
       data centers.  This charge needs to be separable from postage since it
       could be discounted, whereas postage is a fixed item.

     current procedure:
       I believe that the special handling charges are being added to the
       postage charges and entered using one of the programs, BCHARGE or
       RCHARGE.  This does not allow the charges to be separated.  It is not
       clear to me whether this method covers items resulting from work on
       370 type systems.

     project objectives:
       A program or programs is needed which will allow accumulation of the
       special handling charges as separate from postage charges on TYMCOM-X
       and 370 systems.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       A revenue increase would be expected as it becomes easy for operators
       to enter the charges; my impression is that the interim solution may
       not now include all cases that it should.

     qualitative benefits:

     risk:
       The major risk lies in dealing with current software and the "batch"
       charge files.  Any misunderstandings about the use of any of the words
       in the files could affect any of about ten utilities programs which
       also access them.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       The impact depends in part upon the solution; that is which existing
       programs are reworked.  There is is certain impact upon the programs:
       BCHARG, RCHARG, and 370CHG.  In addition, this project must be
       coordinated with MIS since their programs and procedures must be
       enhanced to process the additional charge records which will be
       generated.

     proposed solution(s):
       Add two new record types to the "batch" record files.  Extend 370CHG
       program to handle special handling charges for 370 systems.  Rewrite
       BCHARG and RCHARG, including the special handling charges in the
       process.  Leave 940's alone; use "miscellaneous charge" feature in
       1BCHARG to enter charges.

     alternative solution(s):
       Same as above with the exception that a new program will be created
       instead of extensions (and probable rewrite) to BCHARG and RCHARG.
       The new program will run on all TYMCOM-X's and will process entry of
       special handling charges only.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The EDITOR has many known bugs.  It is still the main editor used by
       TYMCOM-X customers.

     current procedure:

     project objectives:
       Fix the bugs in EDITOR.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Since EDITOR is still the most often used editor by customers,
       problems with it affect many users.  Failure to fix the problems can
       cause unhappiness and negative impact on revenues.

     qualitative benefits:
       It will help keep COEES and others happy.

     risk:

     current problem or market opportunity:
       MIS has been generating some very large MAGNUM data bases (files of
       135,000+ pages) which TITO can't store to tape.  TITO apparently seems
       to loop, storing tape after tape and never finishing.  Our dependence
       upon the MIS accounting information is such that this problem in
       backing up large files is a very dangerous one.

     current procedure:
       I believe that MIS is using the BACKUP program occasionally to get
       copies of their large files.

     project objectives:
       A corrected TITO.  The large files should be backed up daily along
       with the other changed files which are saved by operations.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Will reduce the time MIS is spending to back up their own files.

     qualitative benefits:
       Will prevent a dangerous situation in case of a disk crash and
       rebuild.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Assign a TSU person (or Adele) to find and fix the problem in TITO.  I
       think that this is imperative.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave as is.  Handle the problem in SNARL.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       TELECOPY does not handle files with "holes".  It desperately needs
       updating of its system map.  It was left in an imcomplete state when
       Jean left the company, and its various versions must be untangled in
       order to make such features as 4-digit system numbers available.

     current procedure:
       Presently, a field test version is used to cover cases where the
       system map of the released version is inadequate.  This is confusing.

     project objectives:
       A functioning TELECOPY which handles files with "holes" and 4-digit
       system numbers and whose system map is up to date.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):

     qualitative benefits:
       Many procedures, such as software installation, depend upon TELECOPY.
       A consistent working one will improve reliability of those things
       which require TELECOPY.

     risk:
       TELECOPY is an old program, and any work on it involves some risk in
       terms of programming pitfalls.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Some utilities do not support 4-digit host numbers.  These are SPOOL,
       BATCH, any additional programs using the batch accounting files,
       TELECOPY, and probably PERP.  SPOOL and BATCH and other related
       programs pose a special problem because they share a request numbering
       scheme which must be expanded, affecting all the batch accounting
       files and SPOOL's data bases.

     current procedure:
       At present, SPOOL cannot be used on hosts which have a number larger
       than two digits.  There is a field-test TELECOPY (with problems) which
       has 4-digit systems in its map.  PERP/DEFER is probably also a
       problem.  What we do now will not work in the future.

     project objectives:
       The object is to have enhanced copies of the customer utilities, all
       available on hosts with 4-digit numbers.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       This is a situation in which our revenues will be limited if we cannot
       expand our services due to the current program limitations.

     qualitative benefits:
       Since the TYMCOM-X section is using hosts with large numbers, we are
       already inconvenienced by the software.  Our productivity could be
       improved if this inconvenience could be removed.

     risk:
       The programs involved are old and any enhancement of them is a risk in
       terms of programming pitfalls.  Risks are similar to those of the cost
       code project.  See (adele:930)invest.doc for a thorough discussion.

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       Cooperation with MIS is necessary if the batch files must change.

     proposed solution(s):
       Fix SPOOL, TELECOPY, PERP/DEFER, and any others which are affected.
       It would be desirable to work on TELECOPY in conjunction with a
       general clean-up on that program.  I think it would be advantageous to
       schedule this project in conjunction with the cost code project, since
       the same class of programs is involved.  Changing all these programs
       and the associated files more than once should be avoided.

     alternative solution(s):
       Same as above, except fix only the system map problem in TELECOPY.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       There is no easy way to scan the stream accounting records.  With
       increasing emphasis on transaction billing, there will be more reasons
       to read the stream for tracking of problems and security violations.
       If additional kinds of records, such as royalty accounting, are put in
       the stream as planned, there would be a need for a debugging and
       monitoring tool. If we had such a tool now, we could obtain the
       available information on our current security break more easily and
       more quickly.  Finding the answers to the system 38 performance
       problem is another timely application for such a tool.  A stream
       scanner is necessary in order to do a utilities usage review.

     current procedure:
       There is, as I understand it, a tool that can be used now with a fair
       amount of hand work to supplement it.

     project objectives:
       The object is an interactive program built around a modular scanner.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Savings in programmer time needed to scan the stream will result from
       a well designed automatic scanner.  In addition, revenue increases
       could result from timely work to detect billing problems or security
       violations.

     qualitative benefits:
       This tool could be used by MIS as well.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Assign someone in TSU to write the stream scanner.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave as is, or assign someone in another group to do the project.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The monitor unit has recently experienced a number of disk structure
       problems requiring 3-10 hours each to correct (usually at 4:00 AM)
       which could be easily and rapidly corrected if better information was
       available.

     current procedure:

     project objectives:
       Improve DSKCLN reliability and enhance it to provide more details
       about critical files.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       This project would significantly reduce the down time associated with
       disk structure problems requiring programmer intervention.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Several sever examples of near catastrophic operator error which would
       have clearly been avoided by a reasonable user interface have occurred
       recently:  (1) A 2020 system was rebuilt from tape when an operator
       accidentally zeroed the disk by typing "R DSKCLN".  (2) Ten person
       hours were spent patching up a 2020 after an operator accidentally
       dissolved the structure by typing "DIS" (as in DISkclean).

     current procedure:

     project objectives:
       Improve the friendliness and consistency of the operator interface to
       the monitor and its support programs.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Will reduce costly operator error and OS unit consulting time.

     qualitative benefits:

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       (1) Restrict ONCDSK (FILES subsystem) commands so that the command
       must be fully specified (allow no abbreviation), and require
       confirmation.  (2) Implement the FULL command in ONCE.

     alternative solution(s):

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The means for accepting monitor configuration requests and producing
       and distributing the configured monitor is ad hoc.

     current procedure:
       When a new machine comes up in a center, operations often runs it with
       a copy of a monitor for another similarly configured machine.
       Requests to change that usually are called in.

     project objectives:
       Formalize and organize the procedure for requesting monitor
       configurations.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Will reduce OS unit consulting time and time needed to make
       configurations.

     qualitative benefits:
       Will reduce confusion and assure a better chance of bringing new or
       altered machines up quickly.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Design and implement a MAGNUM data base to control monitor
       configuration.  The data base will also contain distribution and
       administration information for each host.  Write procedures to accept
       change orders, obtain approval, and generate the necessary files to
       assemble a monitor with the correct information.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave things the way they are.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       An on-line system whereby we can easily accept and collect mail
       concerning non-emergency problems would be greatly helpful.

     current procedure:
       Most support questions arrive by telephone.  A special arrangement has
       been made with COEES to send mail to user XCONSULT on selected
       systems.  This must be collected and distributed by hand.

     project objectives:
       The object is to provide some backup for the support phone line which
       we establishing and to encourage, in general, the reporting of
       problems and requests for consulting to be written.  Reporting by mail
       should be extended to those people and groups who will be using the
       support line.  However, few benefits will be seen if it is difficult
       to collect and track request which are report in this fashion.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):

     qualitative benefits:
       An improved mail system will benefit all of us.  Communication is
       always a concern.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Make improvements to the mail system which would incorporate some
       means of routing to a user's "home" system.  The user should be able
       to specify where his/her "home" is.  Assign someone in TSU to design
       and implement this project.

     alternative solution(s):
       At the very least, make improvements to the collection of XCONSULT
       mail.  This could be a program which gets and consolidates on one
       system the various messages from the selected systems where the
       username resides.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Incompatibities exist between the TYMCOM-X and TYMCOM-XX software.
       For instance, when a new transmittal of COPYCR was done (during the
       summer), it was found to be incompatible with INITIA on the TYMCOM-XX.

     current procedure:
       In the case of COPYCR, an old version must be run on XX systems.  For
       other software, the same action must be taken.  This creates support
       difficulties.

     project objectives:
       Investigate the differences between X and XX software, and plan the
       implementation of the changes necessary to bring the two into line.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Better support and availability of XX systems.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       The section documentation needs organization and requires some regular
       work to keep it so.  A computer index to the paper files is desirable.

     current procedure:
       Things have been ad hoc.  Lois Lindley has made a great deal of
       headway organizing a library of section documentation and archives
       (including a data base design), and this should be continued.

     project objectives:
       A usable library of section archives accumulated up to the present.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):

     qualitative benefits:
       The section has benefited by the organization that has been done so
       far, and others outside the section have been helped by getting quick
       access to documentation.  If others can be provided written work, our
       time spent consulting is saved.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Continue to have a TSU person assigned to the task of organizing the
       section library.  This should be followed up by an on-going task to
       keep the section library organized.

     alternative solution(s):
       Drop the project and also the gains already made.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       We have many useful programs written by members of the TYMCOM-X
       systems section and no index to them.  Some also require user
       documentation.

     current procedure:
       The channels of information at present are very informal.  Lack of
       information encourages duplication of efforts.

     project objectives:
       This is largely a matter of getting the information into the INFO data
       base and writing documentation.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Tools improve programmer productivity.  Documentation will help us not
       to duplicate efforts either within or outside the section.

     qualitative benefits:
       Tools improve programmer productivity.  Documentation will help us not
       to duplicate efforts either within or outside the section.  Easy
       availability reduces frustration.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Assign someone in TSU to work on collecting the various section hacks
       and getting documentation into INFO.  This should be followed up by an
       on-going task to keep the section hacks organized.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave the mess as is.

       Having only the software that is necessary and in use should ease the
       problem of supporting utilities.  I feel that the knowledge to be
       gained is necessary to doing a good support job.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       The collection of TYMCOM-X utilities needs to be reviewed for obsolete
       software whose functions are covered by other programs.  If these
       exist (and we think they do), then take steps to remove them from the
       systems.  The solution depends on having a stream scanner program
       available.  The first step is to identify programs which are not being
       used; it is very likely that some of these are truly obsolete.  An
       additional functional evaluations should also be done to locate
       programs which have some overlap.  Determine the set of programs whose
       features could easily be included in other newer software, with
       minimal enhancements.  In the process, update the product data with
       the information obtained.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave things as they are now.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Improvements to INFO would greatly help the problem of organizing our
       systems documentation and allowing good access to it.  Tools are
       needed to aid managers in general software control.  Providing the
       ability to manage documentation on large projects is a good first
       step.

     current procedure:
       Documentation, where it exists, is found in every conceivable location
       at present.

     project objectives:
       At least a good index to software which would desribe where the
       information is to be found.  Initially, this should be limited to
       monitor and internal (to the section) tools and other commonly used
       system programs.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Cost savings are in terms of programmer time needed to find
       information necessary or helpful to project work.

     qualitative benefits:
       Better documentation control makes it easier for all of us to find the
       tools we need and much easier for new people to come on board.  It
       enables project leaders to manage documentation on large projects.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Assign a programmer to make INFO enhancements.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave things as is.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       Provide a convenient tool for spooling on our lab computers which does
       not require an operator and which contains some queuing and status
       reporting ability.

     current procedure:
       We have a primitive unsupported spooler which we use now.

     project objectives:
       A program which runs automatically on the lab computers (with
       printers) and picks up scheduled jobs and prints them.  Slave programs
       on the other 10-class computers (in MPL) which accept requests and
       copy them to the lab computer (we have a primitive one now).  Provide
       capability of keeping track of status and allowing users to see the
       status of a request.  Make possible provisions for queueing on the
       basis of size or other criterion.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):

     qualitative benefits:
       Very fast turn-around for systems people when they need listings.
       Takes some load off the corporate print room.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       We need a good screen-oriented editor which is generally available and
       supported for development work.  (One that we could provide customers
       would also be desirable.)

     current procedure:
       A very limited number of people use TVEDIT.  This can not be made
       available due to contractual and support problems.  VUE, since it was
       imported in somewhat different form, has found a great deal of
       popularity within Tymshare.  (It cannot be provided outside of
       Tymshare.)

     project objectives:
       Improve VUE for in-house users.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Editing is a substantial part of the work that we do daily.  Speeding
       that operation increases efficiency.

     qualitative benefits:

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):

     proposed solution(s):
       Make the following kinds of enhancements to VUE.  (1) Rework the
       TYMCOM-X access commands.  (2) Use paging.  (3) Implement "init"
       files.  (4) Shrink code and speed up display functions.  (5) Add macro
       capability.  (6) Interface VUE to external programs (such as MAGNUM).

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave VUE as is.

     current problem or market opportunity:
       We have a large bug backlog particularly in the utilities area.  In
       practice, anything not top priority just doesn't get done.  This
       leaves a backlog of important bugs, some of which cost us in repeated
       consultations and "firefighting".

     current procedure:
       Everyone tries to work around their problems and must be extremely
       patient.

     project objectives:
       Make a commitment to review and fix outstanding important problems in
       the utilities software.

     quantifiable benefits (expected payoffs):
       Reduction of consulting and "firefighting" time.

     qualitative benefits:
       Our credibility would be enhanced by a general improvement in the
       quality of our utilities software.

     risk:

     impact on other systems (include accounting):
       Not yet clear.

     proposed solution(s):
       Details are not clear.  However we should make a commitment to review
       the outstanding bug reports and fixing the important ones,
       concentrating on those which will have a payoff in reliability.  We
       should write justifications for the problems we are ignoring.  Then
       fix as much as we can, and get up to date.

     alternative solution(s):
       Leave as is.
