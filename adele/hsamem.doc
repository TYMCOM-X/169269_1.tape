     The products maintained by the Systems Development Section which support
     HSA devices are BIONIC, SPOOL, and probably LISTER.  A short document on
     BIONIC may be found on the X's in the file (*6news)bionic.doc.  In
     addition to a printed SPOOL manual, documentation may be found in the
     files (*6news)spool.doc and (sysnews)spool.doc; the (sysnews) file
     contains operator instructions.  The LISTER program handles the PRINT
     command on the TYMCOM-X.

     SPOOL and LISTER both utilize Katakana as well as "normal" ASCII mode,
     and SPOOL does blank compression in both modes.
