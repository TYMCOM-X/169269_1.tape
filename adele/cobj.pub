Improve performance consistency.  *** What is inconsistency really a
symptom of?  Lack of plans?  Written schedules? ***
### Not lack of planning!  Nor lack of written schedules! ###
### More "oversight" and not enough recognition of perspective
    as seen by management due to the mushroom syndrome which
    happens when middle to upper management doesn't give enough
    commitment to doing things thoroughly ###

Become a proficient user of TOPS-20 and the VAX.
### Is this a REPEAT?  Rather than repeat, I'd prefer to strike
"TOPS-20 and the VAX" in favor of the phrase "newer technologies
such as the VAX and LISA".  (TOPS-20 may be a job objective, but
given a choice of "obsolete" operating systems, I wouldn't even
consider it in the running as to my "preference"). ###

Develop systems programming expertise on the VAX and TOPS-20.
### Is this a REPEAT?  Please see my earlier comment! ###

Improve my time management skills by:   ** need to fill this in **
### Aren't we trying to generalize this one, rather than itemize it
    since we came to the conclusion that it isn't necessarily the
    time management skills, but more the prior visible planning and
    communication that we discussed that need working on?u ###

Consulting:
### I wanted this visible, since it is currently a significant amount of
my JOB.  Why is it under "PERSONAL"? ###

Provide consulting support to members of the unit in

Improve my consulting skills.  Give attention to the following:  determining
what is worth the time and what is not, conciseness, and knowing when to back
off.

### I thought that we were considering something about TRAINING, TEACHING
and possibly more involvement with the planning processes for both new
and current projects.  (I do not mean just project design, after the
fact of a project is realized necessary). ###
