The following are needed for TOPS-20 as a development or internal
machine.  Requirements are greater for full center service.

Network File Transfer.  It is needed now.  

    Status.  Darren Price is working on a prototype to test the FTP    
    specification and in response to the needs of the SofTyme project.

    Software development work.  Implement a prototype on TOPS-20 and      
    TYMCOM-X which is as close as reasonable to the FTP protocol
    developed by the task force.  Interface a user-level front end.

Tape File Transfer.  MAGNUM needs a way to move large files (those which  
will occupy more than one tape) from TYMCOM-X to TOPS-20.  MIS may have
other needs of similar scope later.

    Software development work.  For MAGNUM's short term needs, Carl is      
    writing a TOPS-20 program to read TITO format tapes onto TOPS-20.
    The most recent BACKUP could be converted to TYMCOM-X at a later
    date.

Listing Service.  It's a given. 

    Suggestions.  The existing printing facilities may be adequate as is    
    for internal needs.  A network printer should be considered.

    Procedures needed.  Operator notification and delivery procedures.     

    Research.  Investigate the engine work station by contacting someone    
    (Jill Neidrauer?) on that project.  If MIS is a possible user, find
    out about their forms and other needs.

Validations.  Commit a routine to paper; it can be informal.

    Procedures needed.  For requesting a validation, approving it, and     
    carrying it out.

    Possible development work.  A data base which relates people and      
    groups within the company to user accounts.  This data base could
    generate the DLUSER ASCII file which could then be loaded on the
    target system.

Accounting.  Need problem tracking tools and charge-back capability.

    Recommendations.  To handle charge-backs, either (1) use class    
    scheduling and existing TOPS-20 tools; or (2) implement a very
    stripped-down accounting mechanism using information already
    collected by TOPS-20.

    Software development work.  Stream scanning tool.  Possible      
    accounting programs.

Tape Handling.  I do not recommend using archiving and migration 
features of TOPS-20 at the time; if we can solve the problems inherent
in using these features, they could be introduced later.  Operations
plans to use the existing tape library software for tracking and
bookkeepping purposes.

    Procedures needed.  Written procedures and schedules for daily     
    backups with DUMPER; written instructions for rebuilding a system
    from scratch.

    Software development work.  Provide a means to load DUMPER      
    directories into a MAGNUM data base, so that recent backups can be
    easily referenced for file retrievals, etc.  (Vivian is working on
    this now.)

Operator requests. 

    Procedures needed.  Notification procedures for requests to     
    operators for such things as saving files to tape, etc.

    Software development work.  An audit trail for "batch" requests and      
    a way to read that log.

Software distribution.  We need an interim plan and coordination with 
software distribution to assure that long-range problems are handled.

SPR's.

    Procedures needed.  An organized way to submit SPR's to DEC; a means     
    to insure that source updates or patches from DEC (or the section)
    get installed and logged; crash analysis and logging procedures.

    Possible development work.  Extend ITSR data base to SPR's.  Means      
    to track updates and patches.

Common Editor.  Ken is working on providing PEAK for TOPS-20. 

Product List.  Decide which products we will commit to making available. 
Should we include products the division doesn't support?

Mail system.  This is more of a future -- a mail system for the division 
for 20's and VAX's.

    Research.  Look at AUGMENT's XMAILER system.  What would it take to    
    port it?

Tools.  Play by ear.  What are the greatest needs?  What can we import?
