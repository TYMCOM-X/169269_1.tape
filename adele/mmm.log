Re:   EMSAA.server fixed!
Keywords: A91702 

Well, it would appear that EMSAA.SERVER is once again doing its thing, thanks
to a few small hacks.  Please report any problems to me.  Also, if you do
not get this message, please let me know.  Remember that you must have exactly
one address in the TO field when sending a message to be forwarded.  Also
remember that EMSAA addresses appearing in the CC field are not noticed (and
thus ignored).  And lastly, don't forget to keep (EMSAA.SERVER)EMSAA.CTL up
to date with your current name/password.

Re:   SPOOL 6.3

Chicago had a lot of post office requests that needed printing ASAP, and
their usual printer was down.  They couldn't print them on their backup
printer as it came in over another node.  I provided them with a copy of
SPOOL 6.3, and it worked beautifully.  They are happy, customer is not
unhappy--and SPOOL was a success.

Re:   SPOOL 6.3

I'm glad that my changes to SPOOL actually "HELPED" someone to
please a customer.  It's a perfect example of how a "new" addition
to an old product can make it much more effective as a tool, even
if the idea was "unsolicited" (as it was in this case).
/Carl.

Re:   (COEES2506:26)INIT2X.SAI and associated monitor changes

Well, my stomach just wouldn't let me hack the access rights for .ARCON,
even though it would have only taken about 30 seconds to do.  After
thinking about it, I decided that it really belonged as a special
case access right.  So that it now is.  The only time you can
continue a frame that you don't have write access to is when you
are attaching a port to it.  It is still not allowed in other cases.

The change to INIT2.SAI becomes a trivial removal of code to force the
CONT command and the addition of an argument to the ATTACH uuo.  These
changes have been made and exist in (COEES2506:26)INIT2X.SAI.  When the
new monitor is moved to 26, they will want to rename INIT2X.SAI as INIT2
and compile and test it before making it public.

For further details on the monitor changes, see P034.MEM.

Re:   /L01 ??

Well, /L01 stuff for ATTACH, RETACH for COEES works okay on 930.  What's
the plan about version numbers?  Will we keep on with /L## until /L is
fully operational and then release it as /M?  -Bill

Re:   P034/L on C39 with 190 net ports 128 jobs

P034/L is now running on 39.  Operations has been asked to move it
to SYSTEM.SAV.  It is configured for 128 jobs and 190 network ports.
It seems to run fine, but the real test will come with a full load on
Monday.  For fear of running out of freecore, I patched it to the value
I found on the old 39 monitor less the calculated space taken by the
new LDB's and DDB's.  This makes it aabout 64 pages which may give us
some problems if people start opening many files.

Re:   (SPL)FINDIT.SAV

There is a "new" version of FNDFIL called FINDIT.  In addition to the
stuff FNDFIL used to print, FINDIT also prints file size and protection.

It accepts file specs separated by commas, single wildchar of ? and #,
wild remainder of field using *, usernames "or" PPNs, wildcard ? in PPNs
and maybe one day switches.

It is "as fast" as FNDFIL when searching the entire disk, and much
faster when specific directories or ppn wildcards are used.

If no username or ppn is specified, the default is the entire disk!

Re:   new MTS project

I have decided to put in a new MTS project for general technical work which
is done primarily at the request of groups outside the division.  Right now
its name is TSU External Technical -- any suggestions will be appreciated
for a better name.  It has a start date of 4/2/83 and will appear on time
sheets for next week.

Re:   PCOM 1.60 Field Test

PCOM version 1.60 is back up on (SYS:930) for testing.  This version
fixes the truncated log files, and stranded jobs running LOGOUT.  New
features include usernames printed with file specs, /LICENSE (since
version 1.54) and /WATCH.  Please report any problems, complaints or
bugs to CARL.
