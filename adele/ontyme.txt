TYMSHARE ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF TRUCK/TRACE ELECTRONIC
DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION/DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY

     CUPERTINO, Calif., Dec. 29, 1983--TRUCK/TRACE, an electronic
distribution service for locating shipments handled by motor
carriers and shipment consolidators, is now available from
Tymshare, Inc.  This easy to use system provides shippers and
consignees with a quick, single source of shipment tracing
information.

     TRUCK/TRACE uses Tymshare's electronic data interchange
services (EDI-NET) (TM) and TYMNET(R), Tymshare's data
communications network, to gather shipment location messages
(SLMs) directly from computers of motor carriers and shipment
consolidators.  It translates this information into standard
message formats that can be accessed directly by a shipper's
computer system or by using low cost terminals.

     TRUCK/TRACE provides valuable information to expedite
shipments, monitor customer service, and analyze shipment
movements.  It makes day-to-day operations easier by eliminating
time-consuming manual tracing and costly telephone calls.

                                                                Page  2

     Tymshare's Distribution Consulting Services developed
TRUCK/TRACE from ten years of experience with RAILTRACK(R), a
similar service for tracking rail shipment.  TRUCK/TRACE has been
successfully tracing shipments for leading manufacturers,
distributors, and retailers, including a large Fortune 100
company.

TYMNET UNIT LOWERS COST FOR PACKET NETWORK LINK

     SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 28, 1983 -- Tymnet, Inc. has achieved
a substantial reduction in the cost for users to access its public
and private packet data communications networks with the development
of a new, compact asynchronous terminal concentrator (ATC) that can
serve up to eight simultaneous users.

     With a purchase price of less than $3,500, the cost per port
for the new Tymnet ATC is less than $450, about 25 percent of the
current equipment costs for Tymnet network access.

     The new Tymnet ATC measures 12 inches wide by 3 inches high
by 12 inches deep.  It is designed to sit on a desk and operate in a
typical office environment.  The ATC performs automatic, independent
speed detection in a range from 110 to 9,600 bits per second (bps) for
each of up to eight asynchronous terminal ports.  Two network ports
are standard, supporting speeds from 2,400 to 9,600 bps. RS-232-C
modem control signals are available on all ports.  Integrated into
the ATC is a set of hardware diagnostics, including complete communi-
cations and remote reporting software for both terminal and network
connections.
                                                                Page  2


     Developed in the network technology division of Tymshare,
Tymnet's parent firm, the ATC also will be manufactured by Tymshare.
First deliveries are expected by June 1984.  The new terminal con-
centrator complements the Tymnet Engine family, a comprehensive line
of communications processors designed for Tymnet's public and private
networks.

     Tymnet, Inc. operates TYMNET(R), one of the world's largest
public packet data communications networks, and is a leader in the
development of private networks for major corporations.  Tymnet has
installed more large-scale packet networks than any other vendor.

The following was released to the press today. Please post and distribute.

ALASKA'S FIRST PUBLIC PACKET DATA NETWORK SUPPLIED BY TYMNET


     SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 9, 1984 -- AlaskaNet, the first
Alaska-based public packet data communications network, became
operational in early January, 1984.

     Supplied by Tymnet, Inc., and based on TYMNET(R) II
technology, the $2 million advanced packet data network provides
statewide access through sites in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau,
and Prudhoe Bay.  An additional location in Seattle, Wash., gives
direct access from the lower 48 states.

     Owned by Alascom, the operator of telecommunications services
in Alaska, AlaskaNet was installed by Tymnet in just seven months,
and consists of 17 interconnected nodes (communications
minicomputers).  Use of Tymnet proven hardware and software, which
met Alascom's strict requirements, contributed to the short
installation time.

     "The network employs the most advanced hardware and software
available from Tymnet, including our new automatic port switching
                                                                Page  2

system," noted John McDonnell, vice president of Tymnet's
international operations.

     The network nodes provide host computer and terminal
interfaces, switching, data flow and error control, user access
and routing, remote monitoring and control, the recording of
accounting information, and other functions.  The primary
"supervisor," a computer that selects the most efficient path from
data source to destination, together with the network monitor and
control system make up the network control center in Anchorage.  A
backup supervisor is located in Fairbanks.

     The extensive remote monitor, control diagnostic capabilities
of the node and modem systems, along with 24-hour stafffing of the
control facility, give AlaskaNet a high degree of availability and
reliability.

     AlaskaNet supports the same interface protocols as TYMNET,
such as asynchronous ASCII, 3270 bisynchronous, 2780, 3780, and
HASP bisynchronous, X.25, and SNA/SDLC.

     According to George Shaginaw, executive vice president and
general manager of Alascom, "The Tymnet equipment will
significantly improve service to AlaskaNet's public data network
customers.  The network will expand service to more cities and
provide for growth of new data network applications such as
electronic mail, telex, travel reservations, and electronic
banking.  This new equipment coupled with Alascom's sophisticated
satellite and microwave facilities will provide Alaska with data
network services second to none in the world."

     Alascom is a subsidiary of Pacific Telecom, Inc., a
diversified communications company headquartered in Vancouver,
Washington.  The nation's sixth largest independent telephone
company, Pacific Telecom has subsidiary operations in the Pacific
Northwest, Alaska, Minnesota, and overseas.

     Tymnet, a leader in computer communications and in the
development of large-scale network systems, has installed more
independent data networks than any other supplier, and oerates
TYMNET, one of the world's largest public data networks.

     Tymnet is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tymsare, Inc., an
international computer information management and
telecommunications company, providing a broad range of business
services nationwide, and worldwide through affiliated companies
and agents.
