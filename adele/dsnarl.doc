1.1    Intended program use         

     DSNARL is designed to be  used as a companion maintenance  tool for
the  archive program,  SNARL.   For that  purpose, it  will  perform the
following functions:

a)  DSNARL will have a set of "dump" commands for SNARL tapes  which can
    be used for debugging SNARL.

b)  It  will have  a means  of checking  correctness of  SNARL  tapes by
    comparing them with a set of files.  For the purpose of checking new
    versions of SNARL, a set of files can be accumulated  which exercise
    special features or test boundary conditions.

c)  It will re-create the resident directory on a SNARL  tape containing
    a damaged directory.

d)  It will have a recovery  function for damaged tapes which  will copy
    and create a  new SNARL tape  using as much  material as it  can get
    from the damaged tape.

     Other functions may be added as needed.

2.2    Getting started        

     From  the  EXEC level,  type  "R DSNARL"  to  execute  the program.
DSNARL will  type a  short heading and  then ask  for an  initial device
assignment.   The device  name  may be  the  name of  any  magnetic tape
device.  DSNARL will then print out the number of tracks on the selected
device and then prompt for  a density setting.  The density should  be a
decimal  number which  is  a legal  setting  for the  device.   When the
program  is ready,  it  will type  the  prompt character  ">".   In this
example and in the ones that follow, user input is underlined.

3    Command formats      

     In  the  command  descriptions  in  this  document,  the  following
conventions will be observed.   Upper case letters will  denote commands
and key words that should  be typed exactly as they appear.   Lower case
phrases denote variable information.  Quantities enclosed by  "< >" must
be supplied, while quantities  enclosed in brackets "[ ]"  are optional.
Choices will appear as a  column or will be described separately  in the
text.

     Input to DSNARL follows these rules:

a)  The command prompt for DSNARL is ">".  When  additional sub-commands
    (interactions)  are  necessary,  DSNARL  will  use  the  prompt ">>"
    whenever it is requesting input.

b)  Keyword  input  is  converted to  upper  case  before  processing by
    DSNARL.

c)  Keywords may be abbreviated to the least number of  characters which
    assures uniqueness.

d)  A command may be continued on the next line if the character  "&" is
    inserted in the current  line just before the carriage  return.  The
    problem this creates for the user is that only the current  line may
    be edited.  In  order to cancel an  entire multiple line  command in
    case of an error, the user must abort it (see Section 6).

e)  Leading white space (tabs and spaces) at the beginning of  a command
    and trailing white space on all lines of a command will be purged by
    the input scanner.

f)  Usernames  which  are  entered  in a  command  must  be  enclosed in
    parentheses "( )" in order to be recognized.

g)  PPN  numbers which  are entered  in a  command must  be  enclosed in
    brackets "[ ]" in order to be recognized.



3.1    The tape dump mode          

     The dump command causes the user to enter this mode in  which tapes
can be  examined at the  word or  byte level in  terms of  physical tape
blocks and the logical records composing them.

************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
*       DUMP                                                           *

     This "dump  tape" mode will  behave differently depending  upon the



                                   3



type of terminal being used.   After the user types "dump",  DSNARL will
ask the following question:
        Terminal type?  >>

     The legal responses are (others may be added):
        TTY     Use for hardcopy only or dumb CRT terminals.
        HP      HP-2621 (Tymshare-444)


3.1.1    Display oriented terminal operation            

     Display oriented operation of the dump function is an  exception to
the input rules  in that user  input will ne prompted by  the usual
">>".  In addition, echo will  be turned off so that the  brief commands
will not be displayed on the screen; only the results will be shown.

     On  the HP  terminal, some  extra keystrokes  are required  to tell
DSNARL when to  find the position  of the cursor,  since the use  of the
cursor control keys send no  such indication to the host.   Scrolling of
tape  data  is  done by  the  host  using the  editing  features  of the
terminal, since there is  no way to "lock"  a portion of the  screen and
not enough storage in the terminal to write all the information required
at some steps.  Therefore this  will be slower than the  local scrolling
operation.

     The first  event that happens  after selection of  display oriented
operation is the appearance of a set of switches and settings which will
be  displayed continuously.   Then the  user will  be asked  to  enter a
physical  tape block  number.  The  following is  an explanation  of the
switch settings and their values.

indices  These are the word number positions which are indicated  on the
     displays  of  portions  of  the  tape  block  being  examined.  The
     possible values are OCTAL or DECIMAL.

map  This  indicates whether  the  map feature  is enabled  or  not.  If
     enabled, a map of distinguishable logical record types  is produced
     when the user selects a block to examine.  These types  are denoted
     by a  three-letter code, the  same ones which  appear in  the SNARL
     External Specifications document in the Appendix on the  SNARL tape
     format.   An  unrecognized area  is  denoted by  "XXX".   The legal
     values for the map switch are ON or OFF.

selected mode  This is  the translation  mode selected  by the  user for 
     display  of actual  tape data.   This switch  may have  one  of the
     following values:

     OCTAL  Display 36-bit words in octal.     

     DECIMAL  Display 36-bit words in decimal.     

     SIXBIT  Display bytes as  SIXBIT characters.  Words are  treated as     
          six bytes of six bits each.  The contents of eight  words will



                                   4



          be  displayed  on  each line.   On  the  HP  terminal, special
          characters will be shown using the "display functions" option.

     ASCII  Display  bytes as  ASCII characters.   Words are  treated as     
          five bytes  of seven  bits each with  the 35-bit  unused.  The
          contents of ten words will  be shown on each line.  On  the HP
          terminal, special characters will be shown using  the "display
          functions" option.

     <tape  record code>  Any  of the  tape record  codes listed  in the        
          Appendix  on  the  SNARL tape  format  in  the  SNARL External
          Specifications  is legal  here.   Each of  these  represents a
          display   format  that   DSNARL  knows   for   the  meaningful
          representation  of the  record.  See  Appendix A  for detailed
          information  about  these  formats,  some  of  which  will  be
          combinations.

     DEFAULT  This switch value causes  DSNARL to make its  own decision     
          about  display  format.   If given  a  recognizable  record to
          display,  DSNARL will  use the  corresponding format  for that
          record type.   If given an  unknown quantity, DSNARL  will use
          octal format.

     In answer  to the question  about tape block  number, the  user may
enter either:

     an integer         where 0 is the first block number; or
     LAST               to indicate the last block; or
     NEXT               for next in sequence; or
     PREVIOUS           for previous block.

             Figure 1.  Screen display after new block read


     Figure 1 is a picture of the screen after the user has given a tape
block number if the map  is enabled.  Hereafter, the dump  function will
be in one of four phases, SWITCH, HELP, MAP, or DISPLAY.

     In SWITCH phase, the settings of the three switches described above
may be changed.


                                   5



     In MAP phase, the user  may move the cursor through the  record map
and select a record to display by "marking" the map entry with  a cursor
command.  Display can also  be requested from anywhere with  an explicit
command.

     In DISPLAY phase,  the user can scroll  through a quantity  of data
displayed  on the  screen and  examine individual  locations  in various
modes.

               Figure 2.  Screen picture -  display phase


     Figure 2 is an example of the screen during display  phase.  Notice
the "->" at the end of  the last line of the data.  This  indicates that
there is  more data which  could not  fit on the  screen.  The  user may
scroll up to view it.

     The following is  a summary of the  commands.  They are  mostly one
and  two-character commands.   No carriage-returns  are  necessary.  The
cursor is moved to the  desired places using the cursor control  keys on
the keyboard.

3.2.1    REWIND         

************************************************************************
*                                                                      *

************************************************************************

     The REWIND command rewinds the tape and normally returns control to
the program  user immediately  without waiting  for completion.   If the
WAIT option is included,  REWIND will wait for completion  before giving
control to the user.


3.2.2    UNLOAD         

************************************************************************

     The UNLOAD  unloads the  tape and normally  returns control  to the
program user  immediately without waiting  for completion.  If  the WAIT
option  is  included,  UNLOAD will  wait  for  completion  before giving
control to the user.

3.3.1    QCHECK         

************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
*       QCHECK                                                         *

************************************************************************

     The QCHECK command performs a  quick check of a SNARL  tape, mainly
looking at  the sequence  of SNARL logical  records (see  description of
tape format in the  SNARL external specifications) to  determine whether
they make sense.  DSNARL will  report such problems as values  which are
probably out of range and logical records not in the proper order.  If a
record header word fails to  index to the next record header  word, then
DSNARL will stop the check  at that point with appropriate  warnings and
information.


3.3.2    VERIFY         

************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
*       VERIFY [user list]                                             *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

     The VERIFY command  is used to check  correctness of a  SNARL tape.
It  will  compare   the  file  contents   of  tape  files   against  the
corresponding  ones on  disk as  well as  performing the  same  kinds of
consistency checks done by QCHECK.

     If no user list is supplied, VERIFY will compare the  user contents
of tape files against files on  disk belonging to the same user  name as
the tape file.

     The user list may consist of one of the following:

a)  A single  user name.  This  tells DSNARL to  compare all  tape files
    against the files in the single user directory named.

b)  A list of user name  pairs, separated by commas.  Each pair  has the
    format:
            (username_on_disk)_(username_on-tape)



                                   9



    where  username1  corresponds to  a  disk user  name,  and username2
    corresponds  to  a  tape username.   VERIFY  will  compare  files in
    username2 on  the tape  to the corresponding  files in  username1 on
    disk.  Users not  mentioned in the list  will be compared as  in the
    default case (no translation).


3.3.3    DIFFERENCES         

************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
*       DIFFERENCES [<username1> <username2>]                          *
*                   [<filename1> <filename2>]                          *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

     The DIFFERENCES command is used to compare two files or the  set of
files in a directory with the set of files in another directory.   It is
intended as a  means to check  files which have  been stored to  a SNARL
tape and retrieved to assure that the retrieved files match the original
ones.  The lookup blocks as well as the file contents are compared.

     The  filenames may  be  specified with  or without  a  username and
should not contain wild  card characters.  If usernames only  are given,
then  the  processing goes  as  follows.  Each  file  in  "username1" is
considered.  If there is a file in "username2" with the same name as the
current  one  being  considered  from  "username1",  then  the  two  are
compared; otherwise a short message is printed.

     The comparisons  are done  as simple  binary compares.   Since this
feature is intended as a  screening check, a full report  of differences
is  not  given.   When  20  differences  have  been  reported  during  a
comparison,  then  the  remainder  of  the  files  are  not  checked and
processing continues with the next files, if any.

************************************************************************

     The  RECOVER command  is used  to retrieve  as much  information as
possible from  a damaged SNARL  tape, creating and  writing a  new SNARL
tape containing that information in the process.

     DSNARL will prompt the user  for a secondary tape drive to  be used
to write the new tape.  This  drive will be defined for the  duration of
the RECOVER command.

4    Continuation tapes      

     The QCHECK and VERIFY commands must deal with SNARL tapes that have
been  continued  on  additional reels.   Indeed  they  should  check the
continuation tape for consistency with the previous tape.

     When the  logical end  of tape  is reached  during either  of these
commands, DSNARL will print a message indicating that we are at  the end
of  the  current  reel.   Then  DSNARL will  ask  the  user  to  enter a
continuation command.  The legal responses at that point are:

a)  "?" or "HELP" to get a list of options;

b)  "STOP" to  terminate the current  operation at the  end of  the last
    complete file stored; or

c)  "CONTINUE"  to  continue  the  DSNARL  interaction  and  prepare for
    mounting the continuation tape.

     If the command entered  is "CONTINUE", then DSNARL will  unload the
current  tape, notifying  the user,  and request  that the  next  one be
mounted.  The  user will be  prompted for another  command.  One  of the
following may be entered:

a)  A "GO" command that has the simple format:
            GO
    This tells DSNARL that the next tape is mounted on the current drive
    and is ready to go.

b)  A magnetic tape  drive name and optionally  a density to  change the
    current drive.  The format of this command is:
            <tape device name> [density value]
    If this response  is used, then DSNARL  will continue to  prompt for
    commands until it gets a "GO".

Example:  FTA2  6250 BPI  9 TRACK
          QCHECK is at the end of tape  1-1.

          Please enter a continuation command.  >>CONT                                                  
          Unloading the tape on FTA2.
          Please mount next tape and GO when ready.

          >>FTA3            
          FTA3  6250 BPI  9 TRACK

          >>GO            

          Continuing with tape  1-2 created at 19:30 on 31 MAR 79.

5    Command files      

     Command files may be used interchangeably with input from  the TTY.
A command file may contain part of a command (such as a <file  list>) or
a whole command or multiple commands.  Command files may be nested.

     Command  files  are called  at  any point  with  the  character "@"
immediately followed by the  command file name.  This construct  must be
distinguishable  from any  other  input which  may  be on  the  line.  A
command file name is expressed in the form
     [user designator] <file name>
where the user designator may be  a username or a PPN.  There  should be
no spaces between the user designator if it exists and the file name.

     Following a  command file  call, new  input will  be read  from the
indicated  file and  echoed to  the TTY  until the  end of  the  file is
reached or another command file is called.  Since DSNARL will ignore any
line numbers that  it finds in the  input, command files may  be created
with any of the editors on the TYMCOM-X.

     The following rules  and restrictions apply  to the use  of command
files.

a)  Confirmation and interaction will always be done to/from the TTY.

b)  When an error or a  user abort occurs during processing  of commands
    in  a command  file,  SNARL will  terminate the  processing  of that
    command  file and  any  others higher  in  the chain  if  calls were
    nested.

c)  Nesting is limited to a depth of 10 command files.




6    User aborts      

     DSNARL will trap  on escapes (in XEXEC  mode) or CTRL-C  (in PDP-10
mode) and return the user to command level.  A limited subset  of DSNARL
commands, prompted with the special character "!", will be  available at
interrupt time if a command execution was in progress.  They are:

     HELP       help with available commands
     ?          list of available commands
     ABORT      stop the current operation
     CONTINUE   continue with the current operation

     The ABORT  command will have  different effects depending  upon the
command which  was in  process at the  time of  the abort.   The general
rules are:

a)  REWIND and UNLOAD can not be interrupted.




                                   15



b)  Those commands  which move  tape will report  the position  when the
    tape is stopped.

c)  Execution of  a non-tape  command will terminate,  and the  state of
    DSNARL  will  be restored  to  what  it was  prior  to  the command.
    However, it will probably not  be possible in practice to  abort any
    non-tape command.

d)  If an interrupt and  subsequent abort occurs while at  command level
    or  before  command execution  has  been started,  then  the command
    buffers are cleared, and the user is returned to the  normal command
    level.  The user will be advised of the action taken.

e)  If a command file was  being processed, DSNARL will bail out  of all
    opened command files.
