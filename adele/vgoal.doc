1.  During 1st quarter 1983, I will learn and carry out the
    following tasks:

    a.  Distribution of COEES XCONSULT mail.

    b.  Handling and follow through on general support questions
        which arrive as XCONSULT mail.  (This objective proved to
        be unrealistic and is not rated.)

    c.  Bringing up the lab systems when necessary.

    d.  Performing monthly SPOOL checking and follow-through.

2.  At the beginning of a project, write a plan for getting
    started.  This will probably consist of a statement of
    objectives and a list of questions which need to be answered.

3.  I will summarize in writing the tests performed to check out a
    completed program.  (This was done for easily "measurable"
    output.  For the DUMPER and DLUSER data bases, discussions
    took the place of a written summary.)

4.  Finish and release the DUSAGE program.

5.  Design and implement the schema and programs needed to keep a
    data base of the current sets of DUMPER backup tapes for a
    TOPS-20 system.

6.  Implement a DLUSER data base on TOPS-20.



Personal Objectives 

1.  Learn the use of at least two new programming tools per month.

2.  I will increase my programming experience, particularly with
    respect to data structures, by implementing a series of small
    programs, the specifications of which will be worked out with
    my manager.  The first one will be an application for a stack.
    (Two such projects were accomplished.)
