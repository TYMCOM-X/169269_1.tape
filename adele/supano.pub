.body
In order to provide better systems software support, a new telephone
line and procedures for its use will go into effect on January 11.  The
TYMCOM-X Support Line (408-446-6709) is intended to address the following
needs:
.list "1."
.skip 1;
--The support line will provide a central place to contact the section for software
help where time is important but minutes are not of the essence (as they
are when a customer system has crashed).  Most utilities problems fall
into this category.
.skip 1;
--It will serve as an initial contact point and information resource for
people who need assistance initiating a request for help with "routine"
problems.  However, the support line is not intended to replace other
ways of requesting help with non-urgent problems.
.skip 1;
--It will enable us to provide better technical support and make sure
that each caller receives a response.
.endlist

We would appreciate your feedback on the operation of the support
line.  Please let us know if you have any suggestions.

If you have any serious problems using the support line, please send
a memo to Adele Gadol, 20705 Valley Green Drive (VG2-B03), Cupertino,
CA 95014 with a copy to Mike Hinckley.

In order to accomplish our goals, we are asking your help in following
a simple set of procedures for the use of the support line.
.list "1.";
.skip 1;
--Please use the support line for reporting a systems software problem
or requesting assistance
instead of contacting an individual TYMCOM-X section member.  The line
will be available between the hours of 9AM and 5PM on normal business
days.  There will be one person who has the primary responsibility
for answering it during each four-hour shift.  In general,
this will be a member of the Technical Support Unit; at times, other
TYMCOM-X section members will handle it as well.  The person in charge
will delegate responsibility
for solving the problem if it is necessary.
.skip 1;
--The support line phone number is for the use of yourself and anyone on
your staff that you delegate (eg. for Operations, shift supervisors are
a logical choice).  Please do NOT allow the number to go elsewhere.  As
in the past, we must restrict our communication to "2nd level" support
organizations except for unusual cases or by special arrangement.  We
will make referrals to the appropriate support organizations when
necessary.
.Skip 1;
--Before calling the support line, please consider carefully whether
the problem at hand is really a systems software problem.  With the use
of the support line, the section does not intend to widen its scope but
rather to provide a more organized way to report and handle our
existing support responsibility and reduce its impact upon high-priority
projects.  We must continue to expect good preliminary screening and
investigation of trouble reports before they are related to us.
.skip 1;
--If the support line is answered by a message center, please indicate
clearly that you were trying to reach the support line and leave your
name and phone number.  The message center will locate a Tech. Support
person who will return the call and get your information.  Initially,
the support line may not have message center backup.  Until that time,
be persistent when calling during normal business hours.
.skip 1;
--The first time a problem is reported, a number (which includes the
initials of the person who took the call) will be assigned.  When making
repeat calls for information or follow-up of a previously reported
problem, please refer to the original number.  The people handling the
support line will ask for it.  Following this procedure will help us
keep our information straight and will prevent duplicated efforts.
.skip 1;
--In addition to the support line, inquiries will be accepted through the
"normal" mail system.  In fact, this would be preferred for routine or
non-urgent problems.  Please send mail to XCONSULT on any of the
following systems:  33, 38, 118, 930.  Tell us how you would like to be
notified.
.skip 1;
--Please direct user-level questions and requests for consulting
assistance to the appropriate support organization whenever possible.  For
example, a question about FORTRAN or COBOL
should be directed to INSD Product Support.  Many utilities questions
also fall into this category, particularly those relating to printing
(SPOOL and LISTER), file transfers and other network access, and the
PERP/DEFER programs.  We will be building our knowledge of the support
structures so that we can make good referrals.
.skip 1;
.continue;
Requests to us for consulting assistance will be referred to an appropriate
person.  If that is not easy to do, we will try to handle those
requests ourselves which we feel we can treat adequately.  As always,
a question which will require more than 10-15 minutes of consulting time
will be reviewed by a manager first.
.endlist;

Thanks for your cooperation in helping make the support line a success.
.Endbody;
