District No. Investigation       Adele Gadol                      11 June 1981


              This  report is  an  assessment of  the impact  on  the Tymcom-X
      utilities (and the Utilities Unit) of changing the  three-digit district
      number to a four-digit  cost code.  This discussion makes  the important
      assumption that the  cost code, if used  in place of a  district number,
      would be obtained in the same ways as the current district number.

              The programming effort on  our part is potentially a  large task
      and is difficult to determine.  Some of the reasons for this are:

      1.  There  seem to  be  several alternatives  for a  solution  with each
          alternative affecting the involved programs somewhat differently.

      2.  Most  of the  utilities  programs (that  we know  are  involved) are
          inter-related through the cooperative references and updates  to the
          batch accounting  files.  In addition,  these files are  also either
          used by  MIS or processed  into another form  which is used  by MIS.
          Therefore,  some communication  between the  Utilities Unit  and MIS
          will be necessary.

      3.  The  various batch  accounting files  are not  completely consistent
          either with respect  to the usage  of some of  the fields or  to the
          default handling  of numeric  fields (some are  padded with  0's and
          other with spaces, for example).  There are other idiosyncrasies not
          entirely understood.  Expect trouble!

      4.  Several of the utilities are written in SIMPL (a  Tymshare generated
          but now unsupported compiler).  Expect trouble!

              The  types  of  program  changes that  would  be  forced  by the
      district number change fall into two main categories.  The first affects
      programs which check the authority of the user to run the  given program
      by reading the value of his/her district.  This is by far the  easier of
      the two types of changes;  however, we'll probably forget about  some of
      the programs unless  a concerted efforted is  made to find them  all.  A
      search of LUD reading programs or programs which access  the validations
      data bases, as was done in an analogous fashion with 940 date calls, may
      be advised.  The  second category affects  programs which deal  with the
      SPOOL and BATCH accounting files which now carry the district  number as
      one of the fields.

      The known utilities are  BCHARG, BATCH, and SPOOL.  These  programs also
      fall into the second category.

      The known utilities are  1CLEAR, 370CHG, BATCH, BCHARG,  LISTER, RCHARG,
      RECPPR,  (*1BATCH)RBCHG,  SPOOL,  SPFIX,  and  TAPCHG.   Each  of  these
      programs read or write into one or more of the following files,  each of
      which  carries   the  district  number.    The  files   are  BATsss.mmm,
      RTMsss.mmm, BAT370.mmm, PARCHG.DAT, PARCHG.BAK,  SPLCHG.DAT, SPLCHG.BAK,
      PPRBAK.DAT, PPRTMP.DAT, BATCAN.mmm,  and the SPOOL data  base SPOOL.GDF.
      All except (SPOOL)SPOOL.GDF reside in (*1BATCH).  In each case, there is
      no  room  for  expansion  of  the  district  field  without   some  file

      restructuring, which can be more  or less depending upon the  desire for
      consistency.

              There  are two  major solutions  with respect  to  the utilities
      programs.

      1.  Continue  to carry  the district  number in  the  above "accounting"
          files, and make the necessary file and consequent program changes.

      2.  Eliminate the district number from these utilities.  It appears that
          the MIS format for the BATCH data, which is translated from  our raw
          data, does not contain the district code.  In any case, it shouldn't
          be necessary  for the utilities  to look up  that information  if it
          could easily be retrieved later.

          Note that this second  alternative will still require  a programming
          effort, but  it would be  much less.  The  files could  retain their
          formats with the exception of  the district, and none would  have to
          expand.  The programs would be  modified to put a null value  in the
          district field.

      1.  The total "best case" time necessary to accomplish the changes would
          be  roughly 13  person-weeks  if the  first solution  were  used and
          roughly 5 person-weeks if the district number can be eliminated from
          our batch accounting files.  These times do not include  file design
          and coordination with MIS.

      2.  Due to programs  written in SIMPL,  lack of good  documentation, and
          inconsistent  use  of  the  files  in  question,  the   chances  for
          unexpected disasters are great.

      3.  I am reluctant  to do much reworking  of old programs that  are long
          overdue to be replaced by a newer, consistent system.  In fact, I am
          considering an extension to the program which will implement TYMCOM-
          X special  handling charges which  could replace BCHARG  and RCHARG.
          Even  this step,  I consider  a stop-gap  measure, since  the entire
          SPOOL/BATCH system needs redoing.

      4.  We need  to do a  more thorough search  for programs which  read the
          user's district number.

              The times  given do  not include decision  time which  must come
      first in order to settle  on some consistent file formats and  make sure
      that what we are doing is acceptable to MIS.

                                   important to our ability to maintain SPOOL.

              programming effort:  Since the above programs interact with many
                                   of the same files, Jean Roysden felt it
                                   difficult to arrive at a separate estimate
                              for each program.  Therefore she determined
                                   that the estimate for the entire effort
                                   (7 programs) would be:
                                   (1) 2 months, if the district number is
                                       changed.  In this case, some design
                                       effort would be necessary for these
                                       programs.
