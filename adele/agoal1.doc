     they relate to the Technical Support Unit.



     JOB OBJECTIVES      

     1.  I will improve the quality of the planning for the unit by:
         a.  Producing a quarterly planning  chart which is due the  last day
             of the preceeding quarter (except that the chart for 2Q82 is due
             May 31st).  I  will pay special  attention to activities  and to
             milestones of more than 80 hours duration.
         b.  Accounting for all significant variances from plan in each of my
             quarterly status reports, starting with the one for 2Q82.
         c.  If I am given the responsibility for any project  requiring more
             than  one  person-quarter of  work,  I will  produce  a separate
             written plan for each such project.

     2.  I will improve the ability  of the Technical Support Unit  to handle
         routine technical matters by:
         a.  Identifying  the routine  technical functions  performed  by the
             unit  (e.g.,  SPOOL  preventative  maintenance)  and  developing
             "cookbook"  procedures for  at  least three  such  functions per
             quarter.
         b.  Identifying the routine technical activities  (e.g., consulting)
             and produce at least one guideline for each kind of activity per
             quarter.
         c.  Insuring that I use MTS tracking tools on a weekly basis.

     3.  I will encourage teamwork and the development of  project management
         skills in  TSU.  I will  look for opportunities  for TSU  members to
         take initiative.  I will  demonstrate my progress on  this objective
         by providing my manager  with an informal written report  each month
         during the review period which  gives at least one example of  how I
         have done this for each  member of my unit.  (The first  report will
         be for May.)



     PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES       

     1.  I will continue to develop my management skills, especially by
         a.  Holding a quarterly  mini-review for each  person in my  unit to
             improve  communications and  to insure  that annual  reviews are
             completed smoothly and on time.
         b.  Developing a  written list of  routine management  activities by
             the end of 2Q82 and then using it to insure that routine matters
             get routine handling.

     2.  I will increase my knowledge of the TOPS-20 operating system by:

         a.  Reading  available  TOPS-20  literature  and  participating  (if
             possible) in a monitor internals class.



                                      1



         b.  Getting  involved  in   an  evaluation  of   utilities  software
             available for TOPS-20.  Make a proposal regarding the  future of
             the  SNARL  project  and  study  feasibility  of  providing such
             capabilities as are included in SPOOL and BATCH.
