     The visit to TRW dealt with concerns about the 20/20 installation in the
     areas of network accounting, the TYMCOM-XX monitor and utilities
     software, and the microbase-11.  I will talk about the issues relating
     to our section.

     In general, the bad publicity we heard about seems to relate more to
     lack of follow-through and missed communications rather than to the
     severity of any one problem (sound familiar?).  Although much was
     accomplished during the considerable "hands-on" machine time we were
     allowed, the satisfactory resolution of the remaining items and improved
     over-all support will be key to retaining their confidence.

     Given the importance of the support issue, it is disappointing to learn
     that Nathan Gregory does not expect to continue as TRW's contact in the
     TYMNET support organization.  He is filling that role until someone is
     found in the Los Angeles area (Nathan's base is in Houston, and he has
     no plans to relocate) to replace him.  It is unlikely that he will be
     able to do much filtering of software problems on the 20/20, but at
     least we and TRW do have a contact.

     There are three major complaints or requests that TRW has in relation to
     our systems software.  The first of these is that the printer connected
     directly to the 20/20 has never worked properly.  Secondly, they need
     more documentation on the programs which are used by them for normal
     operation and maintenance of the machine.  Third, they want a faster way
     to do backups.

     We were able to make some progress on the printer problems but were not
     able to solve them, as the hardware was not functioning.  It appeared to
     be a problem in the printer interface which must be dealt with by the
     DEC service people who handle TRW's 20/20.  This is an item for our
     follow-up when the interface is working.

     I was not able to find documentation on-line for many utilities which
Trip to TRW of December 3-4                                       Page 2 of 3


     are needed for maintenance of the 20/20.  (Blain asked specifically for
     anything we might have on PIP.)  They did have a System XX Concepts
     Manual and a YAMM.  I left an additional YAMM and a preliminary copy of
     EPM's System XX Reference Manual.  Also, the new 20/20 releases of
     software which I took along contained documentation files.  There is no
     reason why they should not have copies of the on-line documents found on
     most of our TYMCOM-X systems in directories such as (sysnews) and
     (*6news) for the operation related programs which TRW uses.  This would
     take care of most older programs for which there have been no recent
     releases.  I can attend to this one.

     Lacking a means to copy disk packs on the 20/20, Blain Anderson of TRW
     has devised his own scheme using TITO and the incremental dumps to keep
     two sets of packs reasonably synchronized.  The ASP program is now being
     distributed as part of the standard 20/20 software, and TRW now has a
     copy of it with documentation.  This will probably help them out.

     The following list is a summary of issues, major and minor, which
     require resolution.

        a. Make sure that TRW has a working version of LP20FS (load vertical
        forms program) ASAP.

        b. Get the 20/20 system printer to work.

        c. TRW wants to know how to make boot tapes; provide that
        information.

        d. Get support documentation on their systems programs (I have a list
        of them) moved to the TRW system.

        e. In addition to the two latest 20/20 software updates, I brought a
        "J60" monitor, and to date, it is running well.  Blain says that he
        will clean out (sys) and report new crashes, so that OSU can have the
        opportunity to look at them.  I need to check whether the other
        software updates have been completely installed and are in use.  (For
        lack of time, most of these were put in my directory to be moved
        later.)

        f. Work with software distribution to see that TRW gets their
        releases in the future.  This has been dropping through the cracks.
        The fact that TRW's contract calls for machine-readable sources is a
        large problem, but we can't afford to ignore them altogether.  It is
        reasonable, in my opinion, to expect that releases to them will occur
        somewhat later than to other sites due to the extra work involved.
        In the longer term, the distribution procedure could be automated.
        Releases for 20/20 systems could be saved together, including
        sources, as they are archived.

        g. Blain Anderson thinks that the tape drive must be assigned during
        accounting processing.  He will check to verify if that is really so.

        h. I need to check the progress of the new release of TIO and monitor
Trip to TRW of December 3-4                                       Page 3 of 3


        enhancements to support it.  Someone mentioned that TIO reports a
        baud rate of 110 for input and output on the 20/20.

     In order to finish this list, some direct contact will probably be
     necessary.  For other problem reports, TRW will contact Nathan.  In
     general, direct contact should not be the rule.

     I checked on the protocol for obtaining permission to log on to the TRW
     20/20.  As I understand it, we have the permission if we have been
     contacted about a problem.  If not, we should clear the request through
     their representative, Nathan Gregory (713-870-0913).

     Here are a few other thoughts and asides that I found interesting.

        a. The TRW people seem interested in Tymshare's future plans for the
        20/20 system . . .

        b. There was some discussion about the fact that they cannot run
        their two tape drives in parallel; this was once a feature but
        disappeared with the installation in November, 1980.  Apparently it
        wasn't intended as a feature, and the additional tape drive was sold
        to TRW with the understanding that it was a backup.  I lack some of
        the history of this one.

        c. An important point to remember is that the TRW 20/20 was sold as a
        network monitor and accounting collection machine and not as a
        development tool.

        d. I think that a tool such as LPTSPL would be extremely helpful to
        TRW and to 20/20 sites in general.  However, it is not an "approved"
        project, and we currently have no commitments to support it.
