     In order to provide better systems software support, a new telephone
     line and procedures for its use will go into effect on January 11.  The
     TYMCOM-X Support Line (408-446-6709) is intended to address the
     following needs:

        1. The support line will provide a central place to contact the
        section for software help where time is important but minutes are not
        of the essence (as they are when a customer system has crashed).
        Most utilities problems fall into this category.

        2. It will serve as an initial contact point and information resource
        for people who need assistance initiating a request for help with
        "routine" problems.  However, the support line is not intended to
        replace other ways of requesting help with non-urgent problems.

        3. It will enable us to provide better technical support and make
        sure that each caller receives a response.

     We would appreciate your feedback on the operation of the support line.
     Please let us know if you have any suggestions.

     If you have any serious problems using the support line, please send a
     memo to Adele Gadol, 20705 Valley Green Drive (VG2-B03), Cupertino, CA
     95014 with a copy to Mike Hinckley.

     In order to accomplish our goals, we are asking your help in following a
     simple set of procedures for the use of the support line.

        1. Please use the support line for reporting a systems software
        problem or requesting assistance instead of contacting an individual
        TYMCOM-X section member.  The line will be available between the
        hours of 9AM and 5PM on normal business days.  There will be one
        person who has the primary responsibility for answering it during
        each four-hour shift.  In general, this will be a member of the
        Technical Support Unit; at times, other TYMCOM-X section members will
        handle it as well.  The person in charge will delegate responsibility
        for solving the problem if it is necessary.

        2. The support line phone number is for the use of yourself and
        anyone on your staff that you delegate (eg. for Operations, shift
        supervisors are a logical choice).  Please do NOT allow the number to
        go elsewhere.  As in the past, we must restrict our communication to
        "2nd level" support organizations except for unusual cases or by
        special arrangement.  We will make referrals to the appropriate
        support organizations when necessary.

        3. Before calling the support line, please consider carefully whether
        the problem at hand is really a systems software problem.  With the
        use of the support line, the section does not intend to widen its
        scope but rather to provide a more organized way to report and handle
        our existing support responsibility and reduce its impact upon high-
        priority projects.  We must continue to expect good preliminary
        screening and investigation of trouble reports before they are
        related to us.

        4. If the support line is answered by a message center, please
        indicate clearly that you were trying to reach the support line and
        leave your name and phone number.  The message center will locate a
        Tech. Support person who will return the call and get your
        information.  Initially, the support line may not have message center
        backup.  Until that time, be persistent when calling during normal
        business hours.

        5. The first time a problem is reported, a number (which includes the
        initials of the person who took the call) will be assigned.  When
        making repeat calls for information or follow-up of a previously
        reported problem, please refer to the original number.  The people
        handling the support line will ask for it.  Following this procedure
        will help us keep our information straight and will prevent
        duplicated efforts.

        6. In addition to the support line, inquiries will be accepted
        through the "normal" mail system.  In fact, this would be preferred
        for routine or non-urgent problems.  Please send mail to XCONSULT on
        any of the following systems:  33, 38, 118, 930.  Tell us how you
        would like to be notified.

        7. Please direct user-level questions and requests for consulting
        assistance to the appropriate support organization whenever possible.
        For example, a question about FORTRAN or COBOL should be directed to
        INSD Product Support.  Many utilities questions also fall into this
        category, particularly those relating to printing (SPOOL and LISTER),
        file transfers and other network access, and the PERP/DEFER programs.
        We will be building our knowledge of the support structures so that
        we can make good referrals.

        Requests to us for consulting assistance will be referred to an
        appropriate person.  If that is not easy to do, we will try to handle
        those requests ourselves which we feel we can treat adequately.  As
        always, a question which will require more than 10-15 minutes of
        consulting time will be reviewed by a manager first.

     Thanks for your cooperation in helping make the support line a success.
