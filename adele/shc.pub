	The following is the functional specification for SHC, a
program to supplement BCHARG in the processing and charging of Batch
and Spool requests.

	SHC is to be run by the same operator who runs BCHARG in
performing the bulk of Batch and Spool request processing.  It is intended to
be a makeshift means of levying SHIPPING and RECEIVING charges which
heretofore had either gone unassessed, or been erroneously added to the
postage charges in BCHARG.

	To simplify operating procedures, it is possible to apply
postage charges along with special handling charges using
SHC, obviating the need to re-run BCHARG to do so.  This will take the
affected requests out of "HOLD" status, just as running BCHARG would.

	When the operator runs SHC, he or she is prompted for his or
her oper name and password, and then for data identifying the request(s) to be
charged, as well as the nature of the charges.

	The commands which the operator can enter in response to the
"Request(s)" prompt are as follows:

.skip;
.quote(-18,23,0);

	nnnnn#############A specific request number, for which SHC
searches first the holding file, and then the completion file$$When
BCHARG is run, if the "HOLD" response is given to the "POSTAGE" prompt,
the request in question is placed in the holding file, PARCHG.DAT, to
await the application of delivery charges.  The completion file is
BATsss.mmm (where "sss" is a three-digit system number, and "mmm" a
three-character name for the current month).*.

	##################This is the command normally used to charge
individual requests.  SHC will prompt for postage charges when it picks
up a record from the holding file, presuming that both types of charges
will be known at the time SHC is run.  In this event, SHC will complete
the request, eliminating the need to re-run BCHARG to do so.

	CHANGE nnnnn######Alters special handling charges already
applied to the named request.  It will be used mainly to clean up
requests for which one or more of the charges (SHIPPING, RECEIVING, or
POSTAGE) was incorrect.

lost or mangled, and a recap is is needed.

	Two new Batch job types have been established for the
implementation of special handling charges.  They are job types 14
(SHIPPING) and 15 (RECEIVING).  The following diagrams detail the
formats for these accounting records.  As usual, words 0 through 10 are
header information, identical for all job types, while words 11 through
16 are particular to each job type.
