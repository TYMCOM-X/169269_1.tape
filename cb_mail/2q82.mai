I'd like to talk to one of you about BLOCK-IO input.  I had a long list
of questions which has been narrowed down to one or two...  At present,
I need to know something about BLOCKIO's interaction with HIBER, eg. in
the case (wait for x amount of time or receipt of a character) it appears
that the hiber always waits x amount of time, even though it has gotten
lost of characters...
/Carl.

Any ideas?


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 5,1982 20:22
Todd,
  A specific question for you... Does BLOCK-INPUT (tty block/io) set
any of the interrupt conditions such as character received... etc
as does normal i/o ???  (obviously a SCNSER question?).

  I'm hung up while waiting for you to answer, so I'd appreciate a
speedy response if possible.  Call me, if you have any questions.
At the office, or at home.  /Carl.


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 5,1982 20:33
Re: TAPE status

1. The program appears to spend the majority of it's time, at least
   when block-io is used, at that initial 2-minute wait, and the
   monitor must buffer the block-io input for the job quite nicely.

2. The receipt of character interrupt does not seem to matter for
   block-io input, and thus the HIBER doesn't return until after the
   timeout.
       This can be changed to not bother waiting if the timeout is
       not being used.  Thus, it will only wait when the timeout is
       requested.

3. The timeout mode is "Image".  The non-timeout mode is "Binary".
   According to the YAMM, EOT's are ignored in Binary mode.  Thus,
   they do not signal end-of-transmission, and are considered as
   "normal" data.
       This is important, only in that the data written on the tape
       itself after the <EOT> is still pumped at the terminal and
       becomes thrown at the terminal as command input after the
       file is closed.  (This happens when a tape is written over
       with "new" data which is shorter than the old data.)  The
       way to prevent this is to be able to "turn off" the reader
       via program control, and to then read all the available data
       and throw it away, (or CLRBFI).

4. The use of "Image Binary" rather than "Binary" will then allow the
   <EOT> to signal end-of-transmission/end-of-block-io mode, however
   I believe that this still will not turn off the reader.  Any IDEAS
   to whether that is possible to do???  (I tried it in LOCAL... none
   of the ASCII characters seem to have any effect).

5. As a last resort, when the EOT is found, a message which says:
   "TURN OFF READER" could be typed and then it can gobble up all the
   input that it gets for a short while, and stop when it runs out.

5a. The recording (punch) mode "can" start the punch by sending a DC1
   code (^Q)... but again, that is not a problem at present.

I am still awaiting an answer from Todd or someone about block-io. It
may be a monitor feature, but I'm not sure where to look for it, since
SCNSER is a little be large.

/Carl.


From: WRS
Date: APRIL 6,1982 0:02
The monitor never sees the characters when the port is in block IO mode
(that's what makes it fast), therefor, you'll never get a character
received interrupt.  I think that the line received interrupt is caused
whenever a full block has been received, but I'm not sure.  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 6,1982 0:04
I kinda suspected that (never seeing it for each character).  I'll ask
Todd about the line interrupt... unless you happen to know where I can
look in SCNSER (or wherever) to find out myself before then.  Do you
know if a CLRBFI will clear any pending block-io input if it isn't read
before a terminate-block-input is issued, or does it matter -- will it
just be lost?
  (I want it to go away... rather than having to read it and not do
   anything with it after reading it.  Otherwise, it gets assumed to
   be terminal input and it louses up the command scanning with data.)
/Carl.


From: WRS
Date: APRIL 6,1982 12:44
I recommend trying the line waiting interrupt (thats how I would do it).
On clearing the input buffer, CLRBFI only clears the bufferlets in the
host so it won't affect characters in a block input buffer.  You should
probably do something like this:
  1. terminate block mode
  2. send a device control to stop the reader (is this right?)
  3. send a yellow ball
  4. wait for orange ball
  5. CLRBFI
This will assure you get all the characters up to when the reader stops.
-Bill


From: WRS
Date: APRIL 6,1982 12:50
Ah, one thing to try, if we have received so much data from the reader
that we don't have room for it, and we backpressure the network, will the
network send us an orange ball?  If not, this could result in a deadly
embrace if you follow the suggestion above.  A solution would be to read
an discard characters until an orange ball arrives, thus preventing
backpressure.  That's not as nice though, so its probably worth it to
check to see if orange balls work right.  -Bill

I found the RPG problem which was mentioned at the section/os meeting
today.  The problem is that RPG (at least in two places) expects to
find  a zero word at the end of the RPGINI list.  It assumes that it
is there, although it doesn't appear to insure that condition anywhere.
Apparently only 1 zero word is necessary, however I have not yet found
where rpg "mis-calculates" the necessary amount.  It may be that we
have been extremely "lucky" that it always diddles the INI list at the
end of available core and depends on finding locations past JOBFF set
to zero.
  When you do a SETPROC, (possibly other SET commands also) it builds
the new list at (JOBFF), then it goes and looks for the old list.  It
deletes it, then checks again to make sure there was only one.  This is
when it dies... it finds garbage just after the end of the original list
and go <bang> "ill mem ref".

The RPG change that I suggested appears to "NOT" be as straight-forward

Ken,
  I fixed the problem with (CARL)WHEN.  The problem was in the SW!INI
routine actually.  A routine "get!line" was recursive, and while reading
your SWITCH.INI searching for a "WHEN" line, it recursed off the stack
because you had a lot of continuation lines.
  The routine is no longer recursive, and now it works.

  The file (KEN)SWITCH.CAB is your SWITCH.INI modified with a switch-line
entry for the WHEN program.  If you don't have a WHEN entry, it prompts
you with "Who?", to which you can specify any list of names.

Re: Solution to PCOM "job capacity exceeded" problem

Let the PCOM frame (detached or not detached) print a message

    that condition.
Wait until the CREFRM uuo succeeds, either by sleeping for awhile

Thus, if a user runs it /NODETACH he can <esc>/^C out of it, and

Yes, Scott did give me a file to read TMCPOR.  I have not done anything with it as yet.

I ask about TMPCOR reading, since Bill has a trouble report from COEES
for the original PCOM which the "just released" PCOM still needs fixed.
And... while I'm in there, if I can fix the TMPCOR problem for you, we
all can be "happy".

System 930 will be down for a limited period of time either late Monday
afternoon or, more likely, Tuesday morning.  This is to shift its
position in the lab in order to make room for the F4 which is due to
arrive on Tuesday.  System 934 is likely to be moved on Monday.  --AG

Hmmm.  Oops!  (Well almost!)
The parameter stuff I added to PCOM forgot to pass it along to the
child PARCOM.  As soon as I figure out a way to do that, I'll let
you know.  If you ran it /NODETACH - Of course it worked.  If you
set your parameters from inside your CTL file  it works.  The only
thing broken is the /PARAMETER switch.

Anyway, time estimate for Putting in the !foCFM fix and the TMPCOR
fix is 4 hours.  1 for coding, 2 for testing, 1 for release paperwork.
(Coding has been done already in PARCOM) will be testing it later.

Adele, Lois,
  I hung 930 and had to reload it tonight.  Again, the disk drive
seems to be making noise when reading from SYSTEM.SAV.  Maybe that
file is in a bad place on the disk?  I somehow doubt it.  It may
be worth our while to get one of our monitor wizards to look at
boots and see if it does something weird on a device read error?

Okay, I'll hang on to the PCOM transmittal and maybe we'll just xmit
one version.  How comfortable are you that the parameter stuff is
  1. done well from a user's point of view
  2. not likely to affect reliability or introduce bugs
(as soon as you feel good about these things, we ought to just
release it as PCOM - no sense in having two)  -Bill

may be a better way.

Bill,
  Re: curly braces... more reason why it doesn't work.

I tried curly braces in a comment, and the monitor accepts the
close-curly-brace as an escape (unless you specifically turn it off
with TTY ALTMOD or TTY NO ALTMODE [whichever]).  Thus, if a user
has a file with {macro} in it, and parameters are "off" he may
lose his PCOM because of ERROR.

  Please setup DSK:PCOM[3,352477] as a non-standard PCOM and test it

RPG to setup a NON-standard processor for me.  /Carl


From: SGAVETTE
Date: APRIL 13,1982 16:08
Carl,
(CARL)PCOM appears to work just fine.  If you want to see how to set up
a nonstandard processor, look at (SGAVETTE)INIT.SAI.  I think you can
also set one up by CTE SETNON, but I don't know the syntax.  Bill probably
does.   .../Sherman


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 13,1982 16:44
No No No!  I don't have an INIT.SAI myself, so looking at your INIT.SAI

I'll talk to you about it when you have time. /Carl.

Re: Proposed parameter scheme for PCOM

The file (CARL)PCOM.PAR contains a description of the proposed
parameter substitution scheme which I am planning to implement
in the PCOM program to be released to COEES until our future
PERP implementation is done.

Please take a moment or two to peruse the description and let me
know what you think of it.  It is not meant to satisfy everyone,
but to be useable.
/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 14,1982 0:03
Scott,
  I'd like your opinion and comments regarding actual implementation
of parameter variables and values as per the small discussions which
took place on Tuesday, and (although not necessary to read immediately)
as described (hopefully) more clearly in (CARL)PCOM.PAR on 930.

  Because I am not (yet) putting a "limit" on the number of variable
names that a user would define, I have begun to implement the table
of name-value pairs with a simple linked record list (name,value,next)
and the ordered parameters (not yet associated with names) as a 2nd
linked record list (value,next).  Of course, this will work fine.

  I am concerned about keeping "level" (or file) information around
and possibly "forgetting" all parmeter-names defined in a file as that
file is "exited" to really implement PUSH/POP operations rather than
an "absolute" set of names.   Again, this can be done by adding the
proper info to the current records.

  However, Bill mentioned that this would be an ideal use of LEAP with
triplets of file|name|value thus letting me locate and/or purge entries
more easily.  I somewhat agree, but I am leary of having to declate an
absolute number of items (itemvars, etc) and one-day having the whole
program die because some user defined too many names.

  Can you find some time today to talk to me about this (wednesday),
briefly to: (pick 1) calm my fears, reject the idea of using LEAP,
coerce me into using LEAP instead of RECORDS, suggest another approach.

  I'd appreciate it, so that I don't waste valuable time on something
which is likely to "break"? ...  Thanks.  Carl.


From: ADELE
Date: APRIL 14,1982 7:51
I asked Bill (by mail) if he could get together late this afternoon to talk

I looked at PCOM.PAR.  Seems reasonable to me -- but I am not sure that you
have reached your stated goal of being easily understandable to non-tech
(especially non-programmer) types.  I don't have a counter proposal, nor
do I really even know how to quantify what I think is difficult about the
scheme, so I guess that I have no right to complain.  It seems usable.

	About the LEAP items: the new restriction on the number of
items is (due to the ROCHESTER-LEAP addition) now simply an address
space problem rather than 4090.  (You needn't worry about running out).
I have heard that DATUMs of LEAP items which are RECORD!POINTERs or
ARRAYs of RECORD!POINTERs are not always subject to garbage collection,
but, if such things are avoided, then LEAP is just fine.

Re: (CARL)PCOM.PAR

want to correct any that I find (since you may already know of them).

From: CARL
Date: APRIL 15,1982 2:24
Scott,
  Reading through (DOCAIL)TUT3.DOC I found a couple of typeo's which
could be confusing if not corrected.  At least I'm guessing what they
should be: (See!  I was confused!).
{Page 5} under SET EXPRESSIONS, 1. Explicit Set -
  "C)  {item2,item2,item2,item3}"  should be "C) {item2,item2,item1,item3}"

(same example was used for lists, so I suspect that that is right.)

{Page 23} under ANY and BINDIT in the FOREACH ?x,y example
  "THEN FOREACH x,y | A XOR x=y DO <stmt>" should be...
  "THEN FOREACH x,y | A XOR x EQV y DO <stmt>".

  I hope that you had a pleasant evening last night (Wednesday).
As you may have noticed, I wasn't in this morning.  I slept in, catching
up on some missed "sleep".  I will try to catch "BILL" and get his
reccommendations on the PCOM transmittal: (whether to wait a day or two,
plus user testing time, or to transmit the original copy with the
two or three fixes requested).  Unfortunately, the fixes were added
afterwards and will have to be re-installed, but Bill and I can discuss
that.

  I seem to be missing something basic about lists and sets.

The manual says "PUT <item-exp> in <set/list-variable> [bef/aft <loc>]"
and I have defined SET and LIST itemvars which I initialized with
 itmv!1 _ new(Phi);   and   itmv!2 _ new(Nil);  which compiles fine.
SAIL complains about my "PUT SI in itmv!1" and "PUT SI in itmv!2 before 1"
statements and continues with associated DRYROT's in LEAP mostly LEAPSK.

It isn't clear... should I be saying "PUT SI in DATUM(itmv!1)" ???
(Yes, BY THE WAY, SI is defined as STRING ITEMVAR SI;).

If you have 5 minutes to talk to me, please do so... maybe easier than 
either of us harrassing the source file to make it work.  /Carl.

Re: Monitor Commands for PCOM

I seem to recall some comment about "PERFORM" coming from your direction.
The actual "current" implementation of the PERFORM command is said to be
a useless abomination.  (Actually, it seems to be implemented via some
kludge in RPG, such that only RPG commands will work in a perform file).

Unfortunately, the "only" documented feature of PERFORM that PCOM would
not satisfy is that an "ABORTED" perform file can be continued at the
point where it left off.  I would like to campaign for somehow (?) adding
something to PCOM in the future (possibly "NEAR" future) to alleviate
that problem.  That would allow PERFORM to work, and also give us a useful
command for PCOM.

(This message is sent to you only.  Please bring up the idea with Bill and
 Adele and let me know [through them?] if this is feasable).

(WRS)PUSHX.MAC contains code for a SAIL callable routine that will sprout
another frame and pass your terminal to it (al la TOPS-20 PUSH command).
The monitor /K13 and later has the POP command to return to the parent

child frame to get the license the parrent has, give your program WC RC SY,
otherwise that won't work until the license passing UUO is complete.  -Bill

Since DED is much like EMACS, (command characters anyway), it would
be wise to be somewhat compatible, or to avoid obvious conflicts.
I went through all this awhile ago and probably confused enough
FINE & EMACS users myself with VUE.  I just feel strongly about this
and want you to know.
  I have some lists of commands by name and character for EMACS and

Bill,
  The problem with ONCE et al appears to be processor dependent.
I tried F3XJ38 (before my changes), F3XJ54 (after 99% my changes),
F3XK14 (the current one on 930).  No failures of the same type at
all.  In fact, no MISSING OR INCONSISTANT PACKSET ID messages either.

DEFINE, DISOLVE and REFRESH all appear to work as expected, (archaic,
stupid and clumsy -- but as coded).  I need to schedule a KS to play
with, and see if I can find the problem with DDT.  We do not have
an ALL FILES dump earlier than the /K transmittal, so the sources to
any particular /Jxx monitor are not readily available even on backup.

The earliest ALLFILES is dated 11/24 (so subtract 1 week to 11/17) and
that is after all the massive changes, and probably only has some of
the original sources.  I will check further, ...

...which dark alleys would you like me to pursue?

Please do not overwrite the ALL FILES tape-sets for SA1124.ALL or
SA1205.ALL without contacting me about it first.  Also, it would
be nice not to overwrite SA1219.ALL either, but that one may not
be as critical.

If you can use tapes other tapes for the next ALL FILES, it would
be appreciated.  (I don't know when you're going to do the next
set for 930, ... please talk to me about this before you do the
next one --- even if you must call me at home & wake me up.)

Adele,
  Could you please find out whom I should speak with to schedule
testing time on either 118 or 675's hardware.  It is my understanding
that both machines now belong to Dick Ouelette's group (which means
us too!).  It is also my understanding that :675 is being used thru
Friday (today) by Ben Russell & then Dennis Ernst has time scheduled
to test some nodes...  after that (when?) I'd like to get some time
somewhere, prefereably on 118's hardware due to the hassle of having
to write things on tape or disk for "N" versions of the monitor where
"N" is known to be larger than 4, but otherwise unknown.

  I also will probably NOT be in at all on Monday, since I have a
court appointment at 1:00 in San Jose.  I do not plan to work much
at the office this weekend either, unless absolutely necessary.
/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 23,1982 6:05
I sent mail to calstate & tsucoop (I believe that Julie isn't here on
Fridays), asking that she talk to me before she does the next 930
ALL FILES, since I don't want the tapes from last OCT-NOV-DEC period
to be overwritten until this ONCE thing is resolved.  They are the
sets which cover the period of time when I was finishing up the ONCE
testing & the original /K transmittal.
  If she is supposed to do an ALL FILES store this weekend, it would
be ideal for her to use "NEW" tapes rather than tapes from OCT-DEC.
(It also wouldn't be useful to overwrite first-quarter 82 either...).
Do you know what arrangements need to be made for this?

(Gee aren't I good for a lot of questions?)

From: LOIS
Date: APRIL 23,1982 7:47
Carl,
1) Yes, the k sources are now in osp.

2) The reason you couldn't compile a monitor for fo is that the conffo.mac
file in m33 is darren's file without all the usual definitions.  If you want
to compile an fo in osp you must rename the present conffo.mac in m33 to
conffo.exp, then copy over the conffo.mac from osb to m33--then compile
monitor (and then delete the conffo.mac and rename the file back).

  I believe that the ONCDSK problem is not as critical as we had
thought earlier (since it appears to affect KS's but not F3's).
It may be worthwhile to experiment with a KL or KI to make sure
it is only KS dependent, before I jump into ONCE looking for KS
problems.  I'm leaving it up to you to decide whether I should try
to schedule time or not.

Adele,
  As I do intend to do some work this weekend, I will probably
finish up the PCOM stuff.  It has parameters installed, it has
the job capacity exceeded fix installed, it has the TMPCOR read
fix installed.   I am half-way through installing better switch
control which is the last thing I intend to do for now.

  A future enhancement which should go into the next version
should be to do "better logging" so that if the system goes down
the "entire" log file isn't lost, and possibly to have it read
SWITCH.INI for default switches.  Bill knows about these, and
we agree that they need not go into this version.

Todd,
  I'd like you to let me know exactly what kind of problems you had
with 934 when you were refreshing/defining a structure on the top
drive (APA2).  Other than what appeared to be "hardware" or really
screwed-up software from ages ago (which I doubt), I didn't have
any trouble.
  The hardware problem I had was that ONCDSK in FILMAN was perpetually
dying when it tried to come up and got some kind of error indication
on APA2, and said that the drive was "OFF LINE".  Other than that,
no problems.

They are tightly controlled.  Probably, we will have keys for managers; when

them when needed.

From: CARL

I realize that keys are tightly controlled, but I'd like to voice that
if only a few people have keys, then the situation becomes "LESS" secure
since the keys end up getting left somewhere "accessable" to those who
need to use them, and hence also to those who don't need to use them.

I can live with whatever is done, but it is a "hassle" as far as I'm
concerned.  I have more access to CUPC machines than I will for a lab
machine and that is inane as well as ridiculous!
/Carl.


From: ADELE
Date: APRIL 26,1982 21:21
	If, in order to get keys for the group, only a small request is likely
to be granted easily, then such a request is far preferable to a lot of delays
and extra work.  The idea is to get access for those who need it legitimately.
Although I have not talked directly to the "keeper of the keys", I believe
that Mike has judged the most expedient method of getting our needs met.

Bill,
  On the ONCE/ONCDSK problem, I'm seeing really weird things.  First,
everything works fine on an F3.  Second, the message we get about the
packs on a KS doesn't even get printed on an F3, yet even a simple
"Disolve" makes the message appear on a KS, (although I suspect that
this is correct?).  Third, EDDT seems to %HALT the KS processor while
attempting to $X over what appear to be harmless instructions.  Fourth,
Some things work different when I have a breakpoint set in various
places than if I don't.

  Are there things I should know about EDDT which are different than
normal DDT?  I understand about EXEC registers vs USER registers, but
that shouldn't be a problem in ONCDSK/REFSTR!

  Not a declaration of exhonoration, but.. the dispatch code I put in
ONCE and ONCDSK is working fine.  Something else is not working for
the REFRESH/DEFINE commands... as it "THINKS" that it did the refresh
when loaded without DDT, and thinks something else is wrong otherwise.

  Do you think that the old RMXKON could be loaded with a current /K ?

Second, it is easy to become undisciplined about holding to a schedule

  Re: PCOM and why :NOMAIL doesn't work.

I'm sorry... you call cannot be completed as dialed.  You must

your own area.

Um,... Ya! It's one of those things.  PCOM has changed, and I
removed a lot of extraneous commands which now must be specified
in a different way.

:NOMAIL is now accomplished by saying ":MAIL OFF" or ":SET MAIL OFF".
However, PCOM doesn't complain if you use commands which it doesn't
know about... So, you thought it was broken and it was really just
being ignored.  Please update your files.

Re: PCOM

Documentation is in (CARL)PCOM.DOC on 930.  Also on your desks.

Also, I noticed that if a user uses an "UNKNOWN" or "ILLEGAL"
command, then PCOM just merrily goes on it's way and doesn't
tell the user.  (Ken found this one for me, by using a command
which I removed and complaining that it wasn't working.)

Well, I understand that PCOM was an interim PERP program for
COEES so that they could plop their PERP files through PCOM.
My question is... Is it reasonable to have PCOM complain to
the user "ILLEGAL COMMAND" or some such when an unknown command
is encountered.  I talked to Mike, and he'd like to have us
make a decision and then (if we decide to put in the messages)
pass it by COEES as a memo, before we release it to SYS.

anything else of interest?

Nice to have 930 up for a change.

From: CARL
Date: MAY 4,1982 21:20
No, I didn't.  Instead, Ben and I decided to copy the files to tape
with TITO (while 552 was down, we took 930 stand-alone for this) and
then to see if they can be read on 675's tape drive.  If not, they
can always be copied to disk in the center using the STC drives & then
telecopied to 675.  Anyway, we will see how long 552 stays up.

I don't know what progress Ben has made.

After some thought... the GETRAN problem may also be affecting KL's,
but it isn't clear.  I'll let you know as soon as I check what the
RDTIME function does on a KL different than a KS (it is different!).
In the meantime (M33)GETRAN.PAT on 930 will fix the problem unless
we have a processor that doesn't take any time between instructions.

Re: Security Loophole

Not super serious, but SPOOL does not check to see if the
OPER password file has been munched, thus a user could munch
the file and set status with spool (while inside spool).
The license is process-license, but could allow a user to
do things inside spool which he would not ordinarily be able
to do. /Carl.

Adele,
  The file (CARL:930)DSTRCT.MMO describes the usage of district codes
within SPOOL.  To make the changes to simply use zero or blank values
in the database and accounting files is trivial.  However, some minor
decisions such as what a user can see about a request and who can bill
whom within districts and regions needs some discussion before I can
give a reasonable estimate of the time needed to make all the changes.

2 hours to edit and assemble SPOOL, and however long it takes LOIS to
test each type of spool request (such as when SPOOL is first installed)
is the total time required.   It is so easy to do that LOIS could do
all the work in that same amount of time, now that I've found all the
trouble points.

I need 15 minutes of your time to discuss what we want to do. /Carl.

destroys the destroyer by breaking it up on land.  THEN, I got to
attack with a fighter and subroutine FIND had a subscript error

still left on the screen on the land square where the destroyer

Re: Subscript error in EMPIRE
What happenned was that during my move, I attacked an enemy fighter
with my destroyer.  The enemy fighter was destroyed, then my destroyer
broke up on the shore.  However, the enemy fighter still appeared on
my screen.  I had a fighter nearby and during the same move, I attacked
the (dead) enemy fighter with my fighter.  The enemy fighter was then
destroyed? (this is where the subscript error in FIND was typed).  My
fighter then replaced the enemy fighter on the screen.

	One (simple) possibility is to load the appropriate SAILOW
first when loading MKR.  The way to do this is: LOAD (FTSYS)SAILOW,MKR
The problem is the library search order is not quite right for all 
SAIL language programs (you have already searched LIBSAA before you
got to RCHPTR).  Another soultion is to include a (perhaps uncalled)
reference to USETI in your program (ie: ... if false the useti(0,1))

  I. SPOOL nodes:  NODPRI's format is '4000 * 2 words long with
                   node mapping from 0-'3777 for each of customer
                   and internal nodes.  "ANYONE" can specify which
                   map to use, but if the internal node doesn't
                   have a printer assigned, you must be in district
                   0-9 for it to re-try the non-internal node for
                   a printer loc.

 II. COEES notes:  According to the stream records, all 5 COEES
                   sessions in question ran up charges while inside

  FYI - PCOM v 1.13 is on (SYS:930), (FTSYS:33:36).  It has a fix for
        Nick Taddeo's inquiry about logfile operation.  The HELP text
        mentions the defaults for normal and /NODETACH modes, and the
        NEW FEATURE added is that if a user "specifies" a logfile  in
        the command line: e.g. "R PCOM;logfile=cmdfile", then in  the
        case of /NODETACH as well as /DETACH, there will be a logfile
        generated (unless the user says /NOLOG).

For the SPOOL and LISTER district code investigation, your analysis
needs to be channeled into a set of recommendations for becoming
independent of district codes.  It would be reasonable to add the
recommendations to the beginning of your document and follow that up
with the detail that you have already gathered.  It is worth explaining
several alternatives and indicating which one you would choose and why.

The following questions need to be answered:
  (1) Is there a reasonable substitute for the checks made on district
      now?  OPER license district perhaps?  Actual license? Something
      else?
  (2) Is there justification for changing the way information access
      and billing restrictions work in order to minimize or eliminate
      the district checks?
  (3) I need some clarification on what is magical about district 0 and
      district 2.  This, of course, is key to some of the solutions.

Adele, I just talked with Gary Mauldin about the new TAPE v 12.02, and
he will be arranging for the postal service to test it tomorrow.  He
mentioned that they were having another problem with transmission errors
with tape.. is there anything I can do to be of service... or have you
and Bill taken care of that. /Carl.


From: ADELE

The TAPE fire is out.  You should be aware of what it was.  TAPE must
have protection ALL RD RD rather than ALL RUN RUN.  This is because it
gets rid of its high segment when reading and gets it back later using
a GETSEG.  It is not able to do this when the protection isn't right.
You will notice my old transmittals specify ALL RD RD.  I have taken
care of getting the transmittal altered (Dave's original) - Gary Mauldin
is following through with that.  I've also sent an MHX job around to
fix the protection and asked Dave and Gary to follow up and make sure
nothing has been forgotten.  I'll make sure there is an ITSR on the
subject.

Adele,
  From some quick digging, thanks to Margaret pointing at the 1022
databases on system 70, I do have a little info for you.

1) there are no users in districts 4 thru 9.
2) District 0 is mainly OPS, Validations, SRA, and the like
   District 1 appears to be mainly MAIL names on system 8, marketing
              communications and the like
   District 2 is mainly Accounting, Billing, Payroll and the like
   District 3 is mostly internal or development

Re: Letter Bombs.
Since you weren't at the mtg today... Dave fixed up (SYS)MAIL to
massage control-charcters.  I fixed RPG's (MAIL/POSTMAN) commands,
GFD's ACCESS.MSG output, LOGINN's ACCESS.MSG output to convert
all but ^H-^M to ^<char>, rubout to ^# and tilde to ^%.  All are
on SYS: on 930.   Nulls are ignored (now) by LOGINN and GFD, they
didn't used to be.  If no complaints, I'll have transmittals for
GFD, LOGINN, and RPG on your desk tomorrow.

Re: ^ characters, I think we have all jumped to conclusions a bit.  It
is not clear (to me) that we should allow control character to be 
included in messages at all.  Therefor there would be no need to do
any special processing in MAIL, POSTMAN, (SYS)MAIL, (WRS)MAIL, etc.
All that would need to be changed is SEND.  Can anyone convince me
otherwise?    -Bill


From: CARL
Date: MAY 13,1982 20:18
Re: ^<chars>
Either way... but all forms of input must be stopped including reading
from files, etc.  I is much easier to do something reasonable on output.
(typeo I is "It" -^-).  (Especially since it has already been done, also
anyone could create the packets elsewhere if a better mail system is
implemented.)  Anyway, GFD-LOGIN read whatever is in ACCESS.MSG.. so that's
probably not going against the grain of things.  Otherwise, RPG had to be
changed to do something, anyway.
  PS were you harrassed by letter bombs like dave and I were?


From: WRS
Date: MAY 13,1982 20:37
Letter bombs, I got one from Scott, to which I replied with TNT ...
    COPY (WRS)TNT,TTY:
for a demo - its really nice (o}doesn't do anything nasty).  I agree that
GFD and LOGINN are correct.  But, RPG is the only one that can write 
packets into SYS:XOBLAM, but anyone can read them out of (*)MAIL.BOX.
So by placing the burden on the reader, you have an undefined set of programs
which must follow the cumbersome protocol (for example, a user may have a
FORTRAN or MAGNUM program to read his mail).  Placing the burden on the
SEND routine, keeps the control in a known set which is wholely in our hands.
-Bill


From: CARL
Date: MAY 13,1982 20:42
Agreed.  So do I take that to mean that you'd like me to do something
to RPG to try and filter them out on input, a la the same scheme used
for output...  remember that various control characters have special
meaning, eg. ^D, ^F, ^B and (believe it or not) Rubout, thus removing
the code from output, or leave the output code in RPG, but also add
some code to SEND (I think I'd prefer this).  (eg. LETTER puts messages
into someplace --- Right?).

as an alternative.  So, without further ado, it's ....

  I'd like some clarification on what is a "crash-analysis" call and
what isn't.  Somehow, all the HOTLINE calls that I answer seem to be
the type that the system keeps crashing, or has just crashed and they
(meaning operations) want someone to give them a clue to what is
happenning.  That "feels" like routine crash analysis, but I really
feel bad about calling someone about it at any time of day.  Is this
a typical HOTLINE call or am I just fated to get that type of call?

Re: BATCH requests for District 38 on systems 83 & 90.

Apparently, accounting records for these systems ARE being "lost"
for SLIGOS customers in district 38.  All other FRENCH customers
are being written into (FBATCH) for translation, while district 38
is only written into (SLIBATCH) on systems other than 83 & 90.  On
83 & 90 they are written directly into (*1BATCH), but no accounting
is done because it is assumed that the billing will be done on the
subsequent run of BATCH. (which is never done).
-Carl.

According to memo's from Ken Be Del, 83 is to be treated like 90 as
far as french customers are concerned.  As such, I will check into
whether any accounting needs to be done, and whether SLIGOS would
like to collect revenues from BATCH.

Scott,
  I was talking to Adele the other day about interfacing SAIL programs
to 1022.  She mentioned that she tried to do it once and failed, and
that you could explain what the problem was.  She also mentioned that
you had discussed the problem with people at decus to drum up support
for changes to either SAIL or 1022 to make them more compatible... My
questions are:  Is it possible to interface them, and if not easily,
what exactly stands in the way?
  (I know SAIL can call fortran routines...) Otherwise, I'm only guessing
at reasons for incompatibility... eg. the i/o runtimes, memory allocation,
etc.  It isn't important, but I'm interested in doing some kind of 1022
intrfacing to a sail program if it is a t all possible. /Carl.

I have been building little SAIL subroutines which contain marginally
useful procedures for programs I have written or modified recently...
I was keeping a pointer to them in (CARL)HACKS.TXT and telling people
about them from time to time.  I broke down and wrote HACKS.DOC which
is an annotated list of each module, its routines and what they do in
documentation format.  Due to congestion and the tendency to modify
these files in my directory without warning, I have moved a **STABLE**
copy of each module, *.REL,*.REQ (a require file) to the SPL directory
along with the HACKS.DOC && HACKS.TXT files.   Sources too, but please
don't modify without notification or testing since some transmittable
products rely on these routines working.

    1022: I started a SAIL/1022 interface (which got the proverbial 90% done
 of course), which Bill has used, so you could talk to him.  The problems are:
 both SAIL and 1022 want to (A) manage core, (B) manage I/O channels including
channel allocation and deallocation.
(C) they have different record and string formats.
(D) they have different ideas about where arguments are, what registers are
used for, what to do when errors occur.
In general, they both want to be THE interface to the operating system.

	Do NOT treat SPL as an extension of your directory.  Also, SPL
has PROGRAMS on it, not CODE.  There is also a PRUNE directory on SPL which
is supposed to have comments on EVERY file on the directory.  If you want
to fill up MPL with piles of files, see the monitor group, but don't use
MPL as a place for those files you don't want on your directory.  If the
routines are documented, robust, ... then they maybe should be fixed up
to go into SAILIB, but not simply by file transfer.

No --- I am not treating SPL as n extension of my directory.  A lot of
thought went on before deciding to put those routines into SPL. Ok, I
understand "programs" vs code, but aren't .REL files which are, I repeat
"ARE" documented as library routines appropriate for something like
SPL... or should they go into SAILIB?  I don't mean to fill up any
directory with "files".  I'd just as soon put them into "ONE" file as
a library.  I'm asking you what you want me to do with them... advise.

I do feel "yelled at" for what you've said about programs vs code and
now I am confused and feel bad.  Do I just misunderstand??? [AGAIN!]

I will update the PRUNE file if it is OK to keep those routines there.
However, it was my understanding that that was a place for "general"
use by the section for "commonly" useful things, NOT just .SAV files!

Re: Support-Line call about system 24

Debbie of CUPC operations called because TITO was crashing the system
every time they attempted to do the backup for (SYS).  It turned out
that (SYS)LUD.SYS was bad.  Any attempt to read the file would cause a
crash at MAPALL+5 in PCBIO.  Apparently, T1/DISK-POINTER was zero, from
a bad pointer in the file's RIB.  After 3 more crashes I made sure that
a FULL DSKCLN was run.  The first 4 times, only a FAST DSKCLN was done!

I think that a STOPCD for a bad disk pointer ought to force a "FULL"
DSKCLN to be run... don't you?

The crashes are still out on :24,  CRA001-CRA005 for further analysis.
I have a hardcopy of what the stack looked like for all 5 crashes.
Almost all are identical for 16 or so locations.   /Carl.

FULL DSKCLN seems to have fixed the file, as in I can read the file
with CKSUM without crashing the system.  I told Operations to go ahead
with the rest of their BACKUP.  /Carl.

Bill,
  would it be possible (of course it's possible) for you to go in
and patch the running monitor on 930 to track the last set of arguments
given to the frmop call to graft a frame-tree, so that I can go in and
look at what the monitor thought I passed as arguments...from PCOM.

Basically, I'd like a couple of locations which I can look at which would
hold the resultant arguments (defaulted or passed) for a frame graft call.
Then I can force the error, and then go look at the monitor to see what
got passed...  SAIL repetedly in PCOM fails with error-code #3, my macro
routine almost *never* fails (haven't had it happen yet!).
/Carl.

If you could do that tonight & call me to let me know I'd appreciate it.

Using (M33)MDDT, there are 4 symbols in the patch area:
   GFT.J	- target frame number in RH
   GFT.U	- new parent frame number in RH
   GFT.M	- address of user argument in RH
   GFT.X	- a number indicating where !FOGFT failed...
	0: cant give new parent a child
	1: cant give target a new parent
	2: graft would create a loop in frame tree
	3: target FD unable to convert to frame #
	4: cant take parent away from child

Bill,
  Do you know what is happenning to the third moni-module drive for
system 934?  As in... "Are we ever going to get it back?"  In any case,
I'd like to propose that we rebuild 934 using one drive as a structure
which can be wiped clean without care, and the remaining drives (one
at present) as a stand-alone structure as is now.

  You will ask... "Why bother?"  -- Well, if someone has to worry about
whether someone has critical copies of files on 934 (for whatever reason)
whenever testing may wipe the structure, it becomes a pain.  It is quite
unreasonable to expect anyone to have to spend "X" hours backing up any
directories on 934, especially when scratch tapes are not readily there
for the taking.

  Anyway, regarding ONCE documentation from Rick Daniels, I'd like to
wipe 934 and test each of the commands as Rick has them documented to
make absolutely sure that they do what they say, and that no unknown
oddities crop up.  At last I heard, Darren had some copies, "only" copies
of files on 934 which he didn't want wiped...  Also, I'd like to be sure
that BOOTS and whatever else is needed to be done with a raw system can
be done according to "existing" documentation.

Carl,

I just noticed that LOGON reported LISTER as being in TI state when it
could only be in TO or RN state according to SYSTAT.

From: CARL
Date: JUNE 8,1982 13:20
Ken,
  There is only one state "TI" which is reported as "TI" or "TO" by
SYSTAT.  There are other bits which even systat cannot accurrately
be sure that the state is not in flux, however SYSTAT uses them to
decide whether the terminal is doing input or output at the moment.

Since there is a state of flux, I decided not to bother checking.  "TI"
means terminal i/o, not terminal input!

You may now send and receive ONTYME-II (EMSAA) messages on 930.  To do
so, send me mail with the following:
  1. your ONTYME-II name(s)
  2. your ONTYME-II passwords (will be put in a file)
  3. the name of a file to send messages from (preferably EMSAA.SND)
  4. the name of a file to put messages in (preferably EMSAA.MSG)
Once an hour, a program will check and send you mail if it found any
messages for you.  If the file EMSAA.SND (or whatever you call it) is
not empty, its contents will be sent as messages.  The format to put
messages in EMSAA.SND is:
    <text of message A>
    :SEND name1A
    :SEND name2A
       ...
    :SEND nameNA
    <text of message B>
    :SEND name1B
    :SEND name2B
       ...
    :SEND nameNB
The file will be deleted after the messages are sent.  If you want a
copy, send one to yourself.

Could you please have it NOT do any I/O, enter, append or whatever to
the EMSAA.MSG file in the individual username's directory?  Every hour,
regardless of mail received, it appears to update the creation date of
the file EMSAA.MSG!  This is bothersome, and gives the imreseesion that
I got EMSAA mail & missed the message!

?cant read nnnPCO.TMP error code '-262144

message appears because the program believes RPGSW to be TRUE.
the command "LOAD/SAVE:XXX YYY" seems to set something such that
the "START" command at that point (in a sail program anyway) is
thought to be at start+1, or so SAIL believes ==> RPGSW = -1.

Apparrently SAIL programs loaded with LOADER and then "Start"ed
believe that they are started at start+1, such that RPGSW is TRUE (=-1).
However, the same SAIL program loaded with LINK behaves fine.

Macro programs loaded with either of SAIL or LOADER work fine.

  2 string item procedures, assigned to 2 different items, such that

Re: PICNIC

There are maps on your chairs showing the location of our PICNIC
tomorrow.  It is in the park at the end of Stevens Canyon Road.
Please send me mail, or see me to sign up for additional things
to bring.  As you are the last, there are not many choices left.

Any type of SALAD (fruit, green, etc.) or DESSERT (pies, etc)
will be fine.  If you have an extra cooler or something to bring
ICE in that would also be appreciated.
/Carl.

Adele,
  I'm not really content with the actual wording of PERSONAL OBJ. #1
however, that's the direction that I'd like to take that.  Any help
you can muster for rewording will be appreciated.  I will continue
to work on wording.

New feature added.  In addition to reading SWITCH.INI, (for a standard
list of names to look for), you may now specify just the one(s) you wish
to check on by typing them on the command line:

    .RUN (CARL)WHEN ; username-list

Adele,
  I sent mail earlier (cancelled) saying that I wasn't content with
my wording of objective #1.  Due to interruptions, we did not get back
together to discuss my re-wording.

  There is YET another re-wording to be found in (CARL)COBJ.pub/doc
which I am much more content with.  Let me know what your comments are
and if you think maybe the order of 1a-b-c ought to change, eg. 1b-a-c.
(Also whether the section name/unit name need be specified, or if
 "the unit" or "the section" is appropriate.)

Adele,
  I have the support line this morning, but will need to run an
early morning errand (between 9:30 & 10:30) I will ask someone to
cover whilst I run my errand [absolutely must be done so that I
can get some prints back by tomorrow afternoon].  Otherwise, I shall
be in all morning if you have time open so that we can get together
to finish up the details on my review.
/Carl.

Ref: Division PICNIC

Is still slated to be held in the park at the end of Stevens Canyon
Road, however, in view of the current weather, MAY be changed to
Joan Pearson's house in Los Altos.  If you don't hear further via
mail, then try to give Joan or myself a call around 11:30.  /Carl.

so, how's it coming?
  I decided that it wasn't worth while coming back into the office.
I will work on the routine for you and we can discuss it tomorrow
or as soon as it's done (assuming that you haven't written it already).
send me mail whe you get out of the editor & I'll link to you.

I looked briefly at your routine...
   rather then tamper with your style, I attacked the
   equivalent routines in TAKEIT itself.  GETLIC.SAI on
   my area is almost ready to install.  It compiles, and
   if I didn't destroy any of the algorithm, it ought to
   be useable. ... however, it is untested, so let me do
   that first.
If it works, you can either use it as is or attack it to
fit your style.  I'll let you know as soon as it works/is tested.

	Mike looked at the objectives and says they look OK with one minor
suggestion:  In the note under job objectives, change the phrase "should be
re-evaluated" to "will be re-evaluated".  Please send mail -- tell me if
latest copy is still in (carl)cobj.pub.  If it's alright, I'll make the fix
and get a copy printed out.  It looks as if we have ourselves a review.

From: CARL
Date: JUNE 30,1982 10:51
The latest copy is still (CARL)COBJ.PUB ... feel free to copy/rename
it back to your area and make the changes.  Please delete the copy on
my area when you have a good copy. thanks.

I fixed FRMDDT to recognize HALT$X as a special case so it won't destroy
the target frame's PC.  To continue, $P still doesn't work, so use ^T to
get the PC and then do pc$G.  Will fix $P when I get a listing.  -Bill
