     Phase_I/Preliminary_internal_test_version:    This  is   a  limited     
version of SNARL which would provide enough features for personal use as
an  archiving tool  but  not enough  capability as  an  operations tool.
However, it would  be worthwhile to get  a small number of  people using
the product at this point in order to get bugs out and  collect feedback
on its  performance.  As more  features are added  during Phase  II, the
test version which is being used could be updated.

     Phase_II/Field_test_version:    This  version   will   have  enough     
capability so that  operations could use it  on a test basis.   It would
probably be  run in parallel  with TITO for  daily backups on  a lightly
loaded system.   File recoveries could  be accomplished with  SNARL with
TITO available in emergencies.  As more features are added  during Phase
III, the version which is in field test could be updated.

     Phase_III/Full_production_version:   Upon completion  of acceptance     
testing by operations, this version will be generally adopted.

     Phase_IV/Futures:   A  set  of  enhancements  could  be   done,  as     
documented in the "SNARL External Specifications" which could  make this
product much more powerful.

------------------------------ Phase I ---------------------------------

(A)  Complete first pass on  DSNARL external design.  In  this document,
     the descriptions of the  tape examination features should  be quite
     complete; some  of the  others may  be much  less detailed  at this
     point.  The document will  be ready to distribute for  comments (at
     least among PDP10/SPP group).
             (TARGET:  July 6)  (COMPLETED:  July 10)

(B)  Complete the internal specifications for SNARL.
             (TARGET:  July 24)  (COMPLETED:  September 14)

(C)  Recode and debug TABGEN using the parser described for SNARL.  This
     step has carryover into step  (D) since there is a set  of standard
     routines  which  will  be  common to  both.   Some  of  the program
     specific routines will be similar.
             TARGET:  October 23)  (COMPLETED:  October 31)

(D)  Implementation  will proceed  on SNARL  with the  front-end command
     parser.  The entire grammar  and command files will  be implemented
     along  with  intermediate routines  which  will  "parameterize" the
     information  in the  parse tree.   Instead of  calling  the command
     handlers, the intermediate  routines will report  their information
     for the  purpose of testing.   (Later on, the  actual calls  can be
     added.)
             (TARGET:  October 31)  (COMPLETED:  November 15)

(E)  Debug step (D).
             (TARGET:  November 7)  (COMPLETED:  November 20)

(F)  Implement and debug QUIT, the mode setting commands, ?, REWIND, and
     UNLOAD.  Set up  SNARL so that a  substitute disk file may  be used
     for tape during initial debugging.
             (TARGET:  December 5)  (COMPLETED:  December 6)

(G)  Implement  WHERE, STORE,  and NEW  TAPE commands.   This  step will
     include  commands  and  handling  for  user  aborts  but   not  for
     continuation tapes (which will be treated as an error abort at this
     time).
             (TARGET:  January 14, 1980)  (COMPLETED:  January 30, 1980)

(H)  Do a quick internal  specification for the dump functions  (on TTY)
     of DSNARL and implement a  skeleton DSNARL with REWIND and  the TTY
     dump functions.
             (TARGET:  January 30)  (COMPLETED:  February 15)

(I)  Debug steps (G) and (H).
             (TARGET:  June 5)  (COMPLETED:  June 18)

(J)  Implement DIRECTORY.
             (TARGET:  June 16)  (COMPLETED:  July 8)

(K)  Implement RETRIEVE, and GET.
             (TARGET:  August 4)  (COMPLETED:  August 5)

(L)  Debug everything coded so  far.  Implement and debug  any necessary
     DSNARL changes resulting from SNARL debugging.  Debug user aborts.
             (TARGET:  September 26)  (COMPLETED:  October 6)

(M)  Get the SNARL documentation  up to date, particularly  the internal
     documentation.  Starting with  the next project,  the documentation
     will be kept in parallel with the development.
             (TARGET:  September 29)  (COMPLETED:  November 3)

(N)  Implement and debug CUT AFTER, APPEND, and COF.
             (TARGET:  November 19)  (COMPLETED:

(O)  Specify, implement, and debug a DSNARL function which  will compare
     the contents and lookup blocks of sets of files.
             (TARGET:  December 15)  (COMPLETED:

(P)  Test the  current product  in preparation  for release  for limited
     internal  use.  Update  the external  documentation, and  prepare a
     memo defining the usable portions.  At this point, a  release could
     me made for limited internal use.  Since the  continuation features
     would not be usable, this  version could not be used  by operations
     unless a responsible person would be willing to do  some individual
     testing and provide feedback.
             (TARGET:  January 7)  (COMPLETED:

----------------------------- Phase II ---------------------------------

(Q)  Implement the  continuation tape  handling commands  and associated
     changes to the file transfer commands.
             (TARGET:  January 19)  (COMPLETED:

(R)  Debug step (Q).
             (TARGET:  January 30)  (COMPLETED:

(S)  Implement and debug TRANSLATE and UNTRANSLATE.
             (TARGET:  February 12)  (COMPLETED:

(T)  Implement and debug  DEVICE, TID, LOG,  and UNLOG.  At  this point,
     the product should  be usable by  operations and could  be released
     for internal testing.  It could  not, of course, be put  to general
     use before a period of  acceptance testing is complete.  I  need to
     work out a plan with operations for the conversion to SNARL.
             (TARGET:  March 4)  (COMPLETED:

---------------------------- Phase III ---------------------------------

(U)  Specify and implement the ability to handle tape ranges  along with
     other selection criteria within the RETRIEVE class of commands.

(V)  Implement  and debug  the  remaining help  and  program information
     commands.

(W)  Design externals and  internals for tape verification  and recovery
     features of DSNARL.

(X)  Implement tape verification and recovery features of DSNARL.

     The delay  between items  (H) and  (I) was  due to  firefighting on
TAPELIB aggravated by network flakiness.  Also, several months was spent
on TAPELIB to improve its general reliability and resistance  to network
problems.

     Slippage on (L) occurred as  a resu encounters with  tricky or
undocumented tape device characteristics which were time  consuming both
to discover and deal with.

     Potential_schedule_disturbances_to_be_dealt_with:   The  amount  of     
management  time I  am spending  must be  watched closely.   The project
management time for SNARL will increase predictably as soon as  SNARL is
in  internal test.   A project  management class  (1 week)  is  a strong
possibility for 1Q81.
