.Sec General information;
.Ss Document description;
	This document is intended as an explanation of the internal
design of SNARL.  It began as a plan for implementation, and it is
evolving into an internal maintenance specification as the work
proceeds.
	As it will be evident from the load command files and listings,
SNARL and its companion maintenance program, DSNARL, share quite a bit
of code.  The general structure of both programs is the same, and there
are modules in SNARL which have an analogous, similar module in
DSNARL.  The similar modules are constructed with conditional
compilation ("ck!sn" sections are SNARL, "ck!dsn" are DSNARL only).  For
example, SNCLI and DSNCLI differ only in terms of the
special syntax routines which are included to handle the particular
grammar of each program.  Of course, some of the modules in each program
have no counterpart in the other.  This document describes both
programs; in most cases, a reference to SNARL applies also to DSNARL.
	I attempted to structure this paper in a "top down" fashion,
describing first the overall structure of SNARL and proceeding to
a detailed discussion of the processes, individual modules, and the
data structures.  However, some reference between sections may be
necessary.

.Ss Special debugging or test versions;
	Several flavors of SNARL may be constructed by using the
switches "debug" and "production!version" to alter the compilation.
	If "debug" is made "true", then the following differences in
operation will be noted:
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
UNLOAD will be treated as a REWIND command.
.Item;
A keyboard interrupt will be fielded by SNARL as an immediate interrupt,
and the user will be prompted by the phrase:
.ByHand;
	Int or Xit?
.EndHand;
If "I" is entered, then the interrupt is deferred as it would have been
in the normal SNARL.  If "X" is entered, SNARL is immediately
exited.  The user is quizzed until one of these letters is entered.
.Item;
A TRACE statement will be available if the debugging version of the
grammar has been used.  The "TRACE ON" command will set a switch
which causes a trace of the finished parsing graph to be printed
instead of doing the command executions.  "TRACE OFF" turns off this
mode.
.EndList;
	If "production!version" is made "false", then the following
differences in operation will be noted.
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
It will be possible to run SNARL using a disk file as the simulated
tape device and then to operate without GD license.  The initial device
prompt should be answered with the string "DSK".  The file "SNARL.TAP"
is used for tape I/O.
.Item;
LOOKUP rather than ENTER access is made to files which are to be
STORED.  This is a courtesy during debug stages and allows SNARL to be
run with minimal license.  Beware -- other access may be made to files
while SNARL is working on them.
.EndList;
.Sec Program structure and flow of control;
.Ss Modules;
	SNARL will consist of the following major types of procedures.
.List (-4,4,0,"A.");
.Item;
~~The Main program~
.List (-4,4,0,"1.");
.Item;
The main initializes the command device and introduces itself.
.Item;
It reads commands from the user.
.Item;
It parses the commands.
.Item;
It executes the appropriate service function.
.Item;
The main checks and will reset system status.
.Item;
It reports results.
.EndList;
.Item;
~~Parser~
.List (-4,4,0,"1.");
.Item;
The parser translates a user request into a function call on one of
the service procedures which carries out the work.
.Item;
It reports syntax errors.
.EndList;
.Item;
~~Service routines~
.List (-4,4,0,"1.");
.Item;
Each procedure implements a command verb.  Procedures which must share
data structures or functions will be grouped as a "module".
.Item;
Those service routines which are interruptable will have the
responsibility for checking system status during appropriate times
in the processing and doing whatever handling is necessary, such as
aborting itself neatly or calling the command interpreter to process
a command at interrupt time.
.Item;
Certain service routines may also set some system status conditions.
.EndList;
.Item;
~~Interrupt handlers~
.List (-4,4,0,"1.");
.Item;
There will be a process for each abnormal hardware condition and one
for user interrupt.  Special handlers may be applicable for abnormal
software conditions also.
.Item;
At interrupt time, the appropriate process is called.
.Item;
These procedures communicate with the rest of the system using
a status vector and device status words held in global storage.
.Item;
The types of status which must be set are the interrupt type and a
command status vector indicating which commands may be accessed at
interrupt time.
.EndList;
.EndList;

.AtPage_ true;
.Ss Communication;
.Sss System status vector;
	The main and the various service, interrupt, and error
routines communicate their progress through a status vector called
"snstat".  "Snstat" is a string which is treated somewhat like a
pushdown stack.  The first character is always the latest piece of
information.
	Any of the following pieces of information may appear in
the string.
.ByHand;
"K"	keyboard interrupt received (set by "attn!i")
"A"	abort the current task (set by ABORT command)
"S"	stop the current task (set by STOP command)
"C"	service routine completed successfully
"D"	mag tape device error detected
"H"	hung device condition detected
.EndHand;
.Sss Magnetic tape device status;
	Magnetic tape device status is kept in global storage with
the main program so that it will be accessible to the other
modules.  Initially, information will be kept for only one device; it
could be expanded later to a list of devices.
.Sec SNARL and DSNARL - The main program;
.Ss Function;
	The main is the master control for all the other functions
which SNARL performs.  Also found in this module are most of the
global storage, initialization procedures for the global storage,
and subroutines associated with the main program.
.Ss Entry points and subroutines;

.EndHand;
.Continue;
Clear the status vector.
.Item;
Before exiting the program, close and release all opened files.
.EndList;
.Ss Global storage defined;
	Most of the global storage for SNARL is found in this
module.  This includes the arrays used to tailor the grammar according
to user license or other restrictions, the magnetic tape status
information, and the system status vector.
.Turn Off "#";

.Library |(adele)sna010.sai|;
.EndHand;
.Turn On "#";
.Ss Algorithms;
.Sss Changing command sets;
	Using the "cmdset" subroutine (from TDPARS library), the
grammar may be restricted.  At SNARL initialization time, an array
is constructed to use with "cmdset" to create the normal set of
commands for the current user.  This is influenced by the user's
license or, if a debug version, whether a tape device has been
assigned.  This array is stored in "std!g" and can be used at any
time to reset the normal command mode.  If using a debug version, a
device assignment may cause "std!g" to change.  Other arrays are also
defined which may be used to restrict the command set at keyboard
interrupt time, when requesting continuation tape information, or
when looking for a particular phresponse.  This eliminates the
need for special scanning and parsing.
.Sec SNCLI and DSNCLI - The parser or command language interpreter;
.Ss Function;
	This module consists of routines which pre-scan the user's
command line and call the standard TDPARS functions in order to
translate SNARL commands into service routine calls.  The special
syntax and semantic routines which may be called during the parsing
reside here too.
.Ss Special syntax routine structure;
	If specified by the grammar, a special syntax routine is called
during parsing after successful application of its corresponding
rule.  For all of these routines, the "link" parameter is actually a
pointer to the node in the parsing graph representing the non-terminal
token value of the left-hand side of a rule which has been applied
successfully.  Each of the special syntax or semantic routines are
boolean procedures.  If they find no errors in the items they check,
then the value "true" is returned.  A return of "false" will cause the
current rule being applied to fail.  For more information about the use
of these procedures, see the TDPARS documentation.

.Preface 0;
.Turn Off "{}";
.Library |(adele)sncli.sub|;

.Preface 1;
.Ss Global storage used;
	This module uses the record structure definitions for the
parsing graph, the system status information, and the parsing error
information.
.Ss Storage structures defined in this module;
.AtPage_ false;
{FigQ commandstructures, Full, snarlcmdlines, Command Tracking Structures}
	The following record structures are the patterns for the lists
shown in {FigRef commandstructures}.
.ByHand;

.Library |(adele)sna030.sai|;
.EndHand;
.DoNow;
.AtPage_ true;
.Ss Algorithms;
.Sss Command file handling;
	The record structure, "comfil" will keep track of opened
command files (including the TTY).  As a new command file is opened,
its name is reported to the TTY and log, and the information is saved
in an entry in "comfil".  A pointer is set to identify the current
file.  When SNARL gets to the end of a command file, it unlinks the
record structure entry after closing the file.  Input will
generally be done through "pre!scan" to assure that commands are
being read from the proper place.
.Sss Keeping track of multiple line commands;
	For the purpose of locating and reporting parsing errors,
multiple line commands are described by the structure "linptr".  As the
current command is assembled in "cmdstr", the continuation characters
and CR-LF sequences are removed, so that the command can be treated as if
it were a single line.  Each record in "linptr" represents a fragment of
the command terminated by a CR-LF.  The text is obtained from "cmdstr"
using the position pointer in each record of "linptr".
.Sss Parse error printing;
	The procedure "prserr reports parsing errors.  In addition to
printing the applicable message, which is accomplished simply by a call
to "messag" in SNPARS, the procedure pinpoints the offending portion of
the command.  The original command (or command fragment in the case of a
multiple line command) is printed with an "^" pointing to the offending
piece.  The command file is also identified.  The cursor position at
failure, "curhgh" is located in the "linptr" list to get the portion of
the command to print.  The record found will point to the file in
"comfil".
.Sec SNPARS;
	This module consists of the configured TDPARS source which is
produced by TABGEN using the SNARL grammar.  For a complete
description of its contents and function, please see the TDPARS
documentation.
.Sec DSPARS;
	This module consists of the configured TDPARS source which is
produced by TABGEN using the DSNARL grammar.  For a complete
description of its contents and function, please see the TDPARS
documentation.
.Sec SNIO - I/O and interrupts and other general routines;
.Ss Function;
	This module consists of general I/O routines and the interrupt
handlers.
.Ss Entry points and subroutines;
.Preface 0;
.Library |(adele)snio.sub|;
.Preface 1;
.Ss Global storage used;
	The system status vector and magnetic tape status information
are accessed from this module.
.Ss Interrupt philosophy;
	SNARL will not have regularly spaced polling points from which
the normal processing may be interrupted in order to schedule a
deferred interrupt routine.  Since there will be specific points
in the main and service routines where interrupts will be checked, the
polling will be done at these points also.  The explicit polling will
cause the appropriate deferred routine(s) to be scheduled; then SNARL
can check to see what has happened.
.Ss Reason for alternate channel procedures;
	The alternate "getchan" procedure, "getmchan", is intended for
obtaining disk channels for files which are not be opened with the
normal SAIL "open".  The mapped files (being STORED and RETRIEVEd) fall
into this category, since the extended lookup blocks will be needed, and
it would be wasteful to do extra "chanio" calls.  The "relchan"
procedure will release any channel, so that it may be used for generalityy
throughout.  It must be used to release a channel assigned by "getmchan".
.Sec MODES - mode switch setting;
.Ss Function;
	The procedures in this module are the service routines for
the mode switch setting commands:  MODE, OLD, SYS, RPRINT, SPRINT,
REELSET, DSKREP, and TTYREP.
.Ss Entry points;
	There is an entry point (actually a separate procedure) to
handle each command named above.  They are as follows.
.Preface 0;
.Library |(adele)modes.sub|;

.Ss Global storage used;
	The mode switch service routines must access the switch
locations which are stored with the main program.
.Sec FTRANS - file transfer and related commands;
.Ss Function;
	This code is included in SNARL only.  The procedures in this
module are the service routines for the commands:  STORE, RETRIEVE, GET,
DIRECTORY, TRANSLATE, and UNTRANSLATE.  The grouping allows for sharing
of code among the commands whose functions are similar and for
localizing the file list structures to one module.

.Ss Algorithms;
.Sss Creating a sorted list for a STORE ALL transfer;
	A STORE ALL transfer, with or without a starting or ending point,
is done on the basis of usernames in sorted alphabetical order.  The
exception is (SYS) which always comes first.  In order to do this,
the list of usernames obtained from reading the MFD must be sorted.
	The algorithm that will be used is a simple selection sort with
a merge.  The sorted file list is built up in the record structure
"allst".  To start, a group of entries is read from the MFD.  By
selection, that first group is entered in "allst" in increasing
alphabetic order.  For each of the remaining groups read from the MFD,
individual entries selected must be merged with the "allst".  Since the
"allst" is in sorted order, only a portion of it must be compared
for each entry to be merged, starting with the last record
entered.  Usernames which are alphabetically less than the starting
username, if given, or greater than the ending username are discarded.
.Sss Creating a username list for a STORE with GAN list parameter;
	The MFD is be read
the same as for a "STORE ALL", and the GAN of each entry will be
compared with the GAN list.  If the MFD GAN is found in the user's GAN
list, then the associated username will be selected for storage.  This
yields a list of usernames which will be in MFD order and will reside
in the record structure "allst".
.Sss Storage order when writing files to tape;
	Explicitly named files will be written to tape in the order
they appear in the user command.  SNARL does not do a UFD
search on a file name which has no wild card characters.  A wild
card file name will cause a UFD search which may generate one or more
file names; these will be in UFD order.
.Sss Opening a file for storage to tape;
	In order to use the extended lookup block without doing more
than the necessary calls, the files are accessed with the system "open"
and "enter" calls.  SAIL's channel management is not used; in its place,
the "getmchan" and "relchan" alternate procedures are utilized to assign
and release file channels.  The use of "enter is intentional in order to
"busy" the file while processing it.  Files must be closed with the
option bit '40 (inhibit create/supersede).
.Sss Storing a file to tape - the data flow;
	Each page in the ring of pages described by the class
"map1" will be mapped to a page in the current file being
stored to tape.  As each file page is mapped, it is also
pre-referenced so that the disk transfer may be started.  This
mapping and disk transfer can take place in parallel with the
transfer to tape of the assembled file pages.
	As each page is written to tape, then the core page may be
mapped to a new file page, the next one in succession, and
pre-referenced.  The mapping of file pages continues until there
are no more pages in the current file.  In order to keep the page
buffers filled, additional files may be opened and mapped to the
core pages as space permits.  A disk file is closed
when all its pages have been written to the tape buffers.
	When a "hole" is found in the disk file, SNARL will search
ahead (using a mapping call) to the next existent page.  The number
of empty pages is calculated from the page number returned by the
call and the page number of the previous existent page.  Then
the "hole" marker (EMP) can be linked into the assembled page list and
put out to tape in the proper sequence.
.Sss Retrieval order when reading files from tape;
	Files are retrieved from tape in the order in which they
appear on the tape.  As the lookup information for each file is read,
it is checked against the stored form of the user or file request to
see if there is a match.  If the other conditions stated in the user
command are met, then the file is read.
.Sss Opening a file for retrieval;
	This method is the same as for STORE except that the inhibit
create/supersede option is only needed to close problem files which will
not be permanently saved.
.Sss Retrieving a file - the data flow;
	As file data is read from tape, it is moved into the page
holder arrays described by the class "map1".  As each array is filled,
it is mapped to a new page in the disk file being written.  The
write operation is initiated so that the data transfer can be done in
parallel with the tape reading.
	When each array page is written to disk, it can accomodate a
new one coming from tape.  The mapping continues until the end-of-file
(EOF record) on tape is reached.  In order to keep the core pages
filled, additional files may be opened and tape read as space
permits.  A disk file is closed when all its page buffers have been
posted on disk.
	A new disk file is opened (and the information saved in "opn!chan")
as soon as a "lok" record is read from tape.  The reasons this is done
are:
.Preface 0;
.List( -4, 4, 0, "a)" );
.Item;
The mapping routines allocate space when a page map request is
processed.  A channel and file must be open in order to effect the
write page mapping.  If the data pages following were simply stored
in the structure, then it would be necessary to map them later when the
file was created (wasting time).  In the mean time, the data fills
space in the mapping structure.
.Item;
For error recovery, it is best to find the errors in file creation or
mapping immediately before information is moved into the mapping
structure which must be cleaned up later.
.EndList;
.Preface 1;
	When a hold marker (EMP) is found on tape, then the disk file
page count is increased by the appropriate amount such that the next
page of data is written with the correct page number; this creates the
"hole" on disk.
.Sss Tape resident directory - when used;
	~~DIRECTORY command~.  The tape resident directory is always
used for a LIMITED directory.  It is not used otherwise.
	~~RETRIEVE and GET commands~.  The tape resident directory
is read and compared with the file list given in the command to
produce a list of file positions (which may be stored in a temporary
file).  Then the command service routine operates using the list of
file positions.  If the resident tape directory appears to be bad,
then this fact will be reported to the user and an ordinary search
of the tape files from front to back will be done instead.  For the
first coding and testing pass on the data transfer commands, only
the ordinary search will be done.
	~~STORE command~.  The STORE command creates the tape resident
directory after storing the files onto tape.  The directory is built
in a temporary file while the command is executing.
.Sss Management of data pages and other tape markers;
	For speed, it is desirable to overlap I/O operations during a
a data transfer.  In order to do this during a STORE, it is necessary
to continue reading new files without stopping the tape to finish
outputting a file.  During a RETRIEVE, the file page mapping should
continue even if the previous file has not been posted and closed.  In
order to do this, there must be a method to keep track of special tape
records that are being read or written (such as the "lok" records) so
that they may be written in the proper order to the tape (if STORing)
or so that the proper file-handling decisions be made when reading
tape (if RETRIEVing).  The logical way to do this was to link these
special records into the mapping list.  Since the mapping procedures
create the "map1" array space only when a page map request is processed,
it was necessary for SNARL to manage the creation of records and array
space for the special records.  There, the structure "map1x" is defined
to match the structure of "map1".  When SNARL creates a special record
and links it into the mapping list, it allocates the array storage
needed.  When one of these specials is processed, it is unlinked from
list.  "Map1" and "Map1x" are both referenced in the program as "map1".
.Sss Keeping track of opened files;
	"Opn!chan" is used to keep track of opened disk files during
a data transfer.  It is a FIFO list; newly opened files are added to the
end, and files which are closed are removed from the front.  There are
several reasons to justify a separate structure to
keep track of opened disk files during a data transfer.
.Preface 0;
.List( -4, 4, 0, "a)" );
.Item;
If the information were kept only in the special record that links into
the mapping structure, it might disappear before the file can be
completely procesed.
.Item;
If several files are opened at once, a class structure is a convenient
way to keep track of the newest and oldest for the purpose of knowing
which file to close or in order to find the place on tape where the
current file began.
.EndList;
.Preface 1;
.Sss Statistics reporting during data transfers;
	The statistics reported reflect what was actually completed on
the destination device.  For
instance, the report on a file during a RETRIEVE is done following the
closing of the created disk file by the "rdy!page" routine.

.Sss Managing tape device reassignment restrictions;
	A tape device change is not allowed to take effect unless the
next command following the DEVICE command is either a NEW TAPE or
APPEND command.  If the use tries another command, then the old tape
device will be reinstated with notification.
	When a device change is requested, the new device is
initialized, but the old one is not released.  The information is
retained for both.  The procedures, "new!c" and "appe!c", will check
to see if a device change has occurred; if so, they will release the
old one and make the new one the current device.
	Within the routine "xctcmd" (in SNCLI), a check is made for
a device change.  If the command which is about to be executed is
not one of the two proper ones, then the new mag tape device will be
released, the old one will be made current, and the user will be
notified.
.Sec SNHELP - Help and program information commands;

	The help text for both the "?" and "HELP" commands is located
in an external file described in {AppRef snarlhelp}.  The text in that
file is delimited such that the service routines can distinguish the
appropriate information to be printed for either a short or long help
request.  The assistance for individual commands is also delimited, so
that a simple search will locate the portion of text needed to give
help for a single command.

.Ss Customizing the modules;
	As was mentioned previously, a number of the module sources are
shared between the two programs.  They must be customized when they are
compiled.  In addition, there are other options to select which require
conditional compilation.
	Each module source which is shared requires another source file
called "sndsn.sai".  A listing follows:
.ByHand;

.Library |sndsn.sai|;
.EndHand;
	If compiling or loading SNARL, then set !snarl to "true" and
!dsnarl to "false".  Do the reverse if compiling or loading DSNARL.
	To use the BAIL debugger and other SNARL or DSNARL debugging
options, then set debug to "true" and use the command the appropriate
command file.
	To select the test version of SNARL or DSNARL make
production!version "false".
	Remember that the /compile XEXEC option must be used to assure
that the desired modules are compiled when a change is made to a source
which is "required" by one of the modules.  The system will not know
about these "requires".
.Ss Changing the Help Text;
	If the help text is changed for either program, then the program
BLDHLP must be run to create the indices into the text for either SNHELP
or DSHELP.  Then the "help" module must be recompiled.
.Ss Changing the SNARL or DSNARL command syntax;
	The syntax is changed by altering the BNF description of the
appropriate command language and configuring a new parser module using
the TABGEN program.  You must be familiar with the parsing technique
and the TABGEN program.
	The grammar change may also involve a change to the related
module if the syntax difference represents a functional difference.  In
addition, the pre-processing of the command (following parsing) may be
affected.  The places in the program to check are the "xctcmd" routine
in SNCLI or DSNCLI and the associated command executor.

.Appendix SNARL Grammar, sngrammar:
.TurnOff "#{}";
	The following grammar is the BNF description which is used
by TABGEN to produce the tables and parser for SNARL.  Therefore,
it includes error messages and references to special syntax or
semantic routines.
	There are several exception conditions handled by the
scanner.  One is the COMMENT command.  The user-defined terminal
{text} is determined by the scanner when it finds the command word
COMMENT.  It "tokenizes" the remainder of the command as {text} to
make the parsing routines happy.
	Another exception is the handling of command files.  A call
to a command file is detected during scanning, and the file name is
determined at that point.  Prior to parsing, the complete command
sentence is assembled by the scanner.

.Appendix SNARL and DSNARL Help File Format, snarlhelp:
	The help file contains the information which will be accessed
by the "HELP" and "?" commands.  In order for the long and short
help information to be distinguished and to separate the text for
the various commands, a simple file format must be used.
	Help text is interleaved with text separator commands which
begin with "{" and are terminated by "}".  Each should contain the
symbol for the token value of the SNARL or DSNARL command word followed
by either "s" or "l" or both, all separated by commas.  For example:
.ByHand;
	{!rewind,s,l}
.EndHand;
.Continue;
The "s" denotes the beginning of "short" text which is typed in response
to the "?" command.  the "l" denotes the beginning of "long" text which
is typed in response to the "HElP" command.  The end of the block of
text which follows is determined by either the next separator command
or the end-of-file.
	~~Possible enhancement~.  It may be desirable to create
an additional level of text separation for parameter descriptions.  This
would enable the expansion of the help facility to include portions
of commands.
