1.1    Function       

     The function of TABGEN is to produce configured parsers and related
tables  using  the  basic TDPARS  routines  and  a  language description
supplied by the user.  The output of TABGEN is a SAIL source  file which
can  be  compiled  and loaded  with  the  program which  is  to  use the
configured parser.

2    Creating a configured parser        

     There are a number of things that must be done by TABGEN  to create
a configured  parser from  the BNF  grammar description.   The necessary
data structures must be created and the PARSE routine modified to handle
the execution of the special syntax and semantic routines.

A.  All the symbols  in the BNF grammar  description must be  assigned a
    token number.   Symbol definitions are  produced in the  SAIL output                     
    for    the   non-terminal    and   user-defined    terminal   symbol
    representations.  For instance, the grammar item "<statement>" might
    produce the definition:
            DEFINE !statement = '1;
    The character "!" is appended to the beginning of each such word, so
    that the user can easily avoid creating duplicate symbols in his/her
    program which would interfere.   The character "_" is  translated to
    "!".   These  definitions  allow  for  meaningful  searching  of the
    finished parsing graph by the user program.

B.  The SAIL source for the token table must be produced.  This involves
    the definition of  and loading of proper  values for the  two arrays
    KEYWRD and KEYTOK.

C.  The  SAIL  source  for  the error  message  array,  MESSGS,  must be
    generated.

D.  The  dictionary  GRAMR  must be  generated.   This  is  the internal
    representation of the language,  whose BNF description must  be read
    from a file supplied by the user.

E.  Special syntax or semantic  routines are called from PARSE  within a
    case  statement.   The standard  TDPARS  file will  contain  a PARSE



                                   1



    without this case statement, which must be built by TABGEN using the
    information about these routines in the BNF language description.




3    Using TABGEN      



3.1    Preparation       

     Before using TABGEN, a grammar  must be prepared.  Appendix A  is a
BNF representation of the structure of a legal grammar, itself specified
according  to  the rules.   It  is, in  fact,  the grammar  used  by the
configured parser for TABGEN itself.

     Here are a few rules to make the interpretation of the BNF  rules a
little easier to follow.

A)  A  statement line  consists  of one  of three  things:   a delimiter
    definition,  the left-hand  side  of a  rule or  production,  or the
    right-hand side of a rule or production.

B)  Delimiter definitions are  needed for special characters  which will
    appear  as  primitives  in the  grammar.   In  addition  to allowing
    unprintable or  undistinguishable characters to  be used  within the
    grammar rules, these definitions associate a meaningful  symbol with
    the character so that the token value of the character may  later be
    referenced.  Some special  characters could cause  problems, because
    TABGEN tries to create a symbol for the SAIL symbol definition using
    the grammar symbol (in  this case, the special character)  which may
    not be a legal SAIL name.  Therefore the delimiter definition allows
    a symbol (treated as a  user-defined terminal) to be equated  to the
    ASCII value of the character such that the character  is substituted
    for the symbol  when the BNF  description is interpreted  by TABGEN.
    The value supplied in the statement should be an octal value.

C)  The left-hand side statement  must contain the representation  for a
    non-terminal  symbol.   In  addition, it  may  optionally  contain a
    subroutine name, or an  error string, or both.  The  subroutine name
    is  enclosed  in  brackets,  and the  error  string  is  enclosed in
    quotation marks, either the single or double variety.

D)  The right-hand side statement is  a definition of the symbol  in the
    last left-hand side  statement.  It is  correct to follow  the left-
    hand side  with a  series of right-hand  sides.  The  next left-hand
    side statement terminates the production.

E)  An end-of-file terminates the final production.

F)  Blank lines in the BNF description file are ignored.

G)  The input is free form; the placement of blanks is not crucial.


                                   2



3.2    Running TABGEN        

     Run the program with the exec level command:

.R TABGEN

     TABGEN  will first  prompt  for the  grammar file.   Enter  a legal
TYMCOM-X file name.

     Next, TABGEN will prompt for the parser file.  This will be used to
output the configured parser source.

     The next prompt will be for the symbol definition file.   This will
contain  the  symbol  definitions  only;  the  configured   parser  must
"require" this  file.  The symbol  definitions are stored  separately to
make  it  easy for  other  program  sources which  will  be  using these
definitions to include them.

     After this file information  has been entered and  verified, TABGEN
proceeds to create the configured parser and symbol definition file.  It
is a two-pass operation with errors in the grammar rules  being detected
during  the  first pass.   Other  logic errors  such  as  undefined non-
terminal symbols will be  detected during the second pass.   TABGEN will
print a message when each pass is complete.

     In general,  errors found while  processing the grammar  will cause
TABGEN to  be aborted.  Syntax  errors will be  reported along  with the
statment  which caused  the problem,  while other  logic errors  will be
reported as a brief explanation of the error.




4    Program structure and flow of control          



4.1    Structure       

     Since TABGEN has conceptually one main task to accomplish, it has a
simple  structure,  a main  program  and subroutines.   TABGEN  does not
handle its own  interrupts; if the user  interrupts with ESC  or CTRL-C,
then the program will be aborted.  The parser for the grammar statements
is built using TDPARS and TABGEN itself.



4.2    Sequence of operations of main program            

A)  Initialize the data structures.

B)  Get the grammar file  name from the user  and try to open  the file.
    If unsuccessful, let user try again.



                                   3



C)  Get the parser file name from the user and try to open the  file for
    exclusive writing.  Let the user try again if the ENTER fails.

D)  Get the name of the symbol definition file from the user and  try to
    open the file for exclusive writing.  Let the user try again  if the
    ENTER fails.

E)  Pass  one:  For  each grammar  statement, parse  it and  execute the      appropriate  routine which  will save  the information  expressed in
    that statement.

F)  Release the grammar file.

G)  Pass two:   Build the  finished parser  from the  intermediate forms     
    accumulated during pass one.

H)  Release remaining files and terminate.



4.3    Pass one handling of grammar statements            

     During  the  first  pass,  the  grammar  rules  are  read  and  the
information  accumulated into  intermediate  data forms  from  which the
final configured parser  and its tables are  built.  For the  purpose of
building  the  internal  data  structures,  three  statement  types  are
significant:   delimiter  definitions,  left-hand  sides  of  rules, and
right-hand sides of rules.


4.3.1    Delimiter definitions          

A)  Get the symbol which is to be equated to the special  character, and
    create the symbol to be used in the SAIL source.

B)  Enter the  symbol into a  list of terminal  symbols, and  update the
    current token counts.

C)  Find the value of the special character from the BNF  statement.  If
    given as  an octal value,  convert it to  string.  Enter  that value
    into the keyword list.


4.3.2    Left-hand sides of rules            

A)  Get the BNF symbol for  the non-terminal which will be  defined, and
    create the symbol to be used in the SAIL source.

B)  Enter the symbol into a list of non-terminal symbols, and update the
    current token counts.

C)  Create  a skeleton  dictionary  entry for  the  intermediate grammar
    structure.



                                   4



D)  Find out if a subroutine name was specified.  If so, enter it in the
    subroutine name structure, and save the index in the current grammar
    structure entry.

E)  Find out if an error string  was specified.  If so, enter it  in the
    error  message array,  and  save the  index in  the  current grammar
    structure entry.

F)  Create a skeleton right-hand-side link entry.


4.3.3    Right-hand sides of rules            

A)  Process each  element in the  statement.  For  non-terminal symbols,
    create the new symbol, and enter it into the  appropriate structure.
    For terminal symbols,  create the new symbol  and enter it  into the
    appropriate table.   If the  terminal is a  keyword, then  enter the
    keyword string into the appropriate table.  In either case, create a
    new skeleton dictionary entry.

B)  When finished  with all  the elements in  the statement,  create the
    end-of-chain marker.



4.4    Pass two creation of configured parser            

     In this step, TABGEN  uses the intermediate data structures  it has
built and the  standard TDPARS file to  build a configured  parser.  The
tables and data structures and any necessary "requires" are  merged with
the  standard TDPARS  file.  The  symbol definitions  are put  out  in a
separate file.

A)  Do additional error  checking on the intermediate  structures.  Make
    sure non-terminals have been defined and put in "dummy"  rules (with
    no right-hand sides) if not.  Warn the user.

B)  Create the symbol definition file and close it.

C)  Now work on the parser file.  Copy from TDPARS to the parser file up
    to  the  point  where   the  "require"  statement  for   the  symbol
    definitions is needed.  Output that "require" statement.

D)  Next, build and output the final grammar, working from  the internal
    record structure.

E)  Build the token table which consist of the arrays KEYWRD and KEYTOK.

F)  Build the error message table, the array MESSGS.

G)  Copy from TDPARS to the parser  file up to the point in  PARSE where
    the case statement for subroutine execution will be inserted.




                                   5



H)  Build the special syntax subroutine case statement, and output it to
    the parser file.

I)  Copy the remainder of the standard TDPARS file to the parser file.




5    Data structures      

     Most of  the storage in  TABGEN is for  the purpose of  holding the
intermediate forms of each the  TDPARS tables which is being  built from
the  grammar  description.    For  ease  of  handling   dynamic  storage
allocation, these forms are built as record structures.

     In the following  grammar, there are several  user-defined terminal
symbols.  Here are there meanings.

{identifier} 
This is  a distinguishable  string of  characters which  are legal  as a
symbol name.  Fundamentally,  it should be  a proper SAIL  variable name
with the exception that the character "_" is also accepted.  There are a
few places in the grammar,  such as the subroutine name, where  a proper
SAIL  name is  a must;  in these  places, a  special routine  checks the
symbol name for correctness.

{integer} 
This is an unsigned positive integer.

{string} 
This is a string of  characters enclosed in quotation marks,  either the
single or double variety.

     Notice that a terminal symbol keyword (not a user-defined terminal)
is the {string} type.  This is to allow grammars with  keywords composed
of "strange" characters which might cause problems with parsing.
