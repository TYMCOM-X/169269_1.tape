.Sec General information;
.Ss Intended program use;
	DSNARL is designed to be used as a companion maintenance
tool for the archive program, SNARL.  For that purpose, it will perform
the following functions:
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
DSNARL will have a set of "dump" commands for SNARL tapes which
can be used for debugging SNARL.
.Item;
It will have a means of checking correctness of SNARL tapes by
comparing them with a set of files.  For the purpose of checking
new versions of SNARL, a set of files can be accumulated which
exercise special features or test boundary conditions.
.Item;
It will re-create the resident directory on a SNARL tape
containing a damaged directory.
.Item;
It will have a recovery function for damaged tapes which
will copy and create a new SNARL tape using as much material as it
can get from the damaged tape.
.EndList;
	Other functions may be added as needed.

.Ss Getting started;
	From
the EXEC level, type "R DSNARL" to execute the program.  DSNARL will
type a short heading and then ask for an initial device
assignment.  The device name may be the name of any magnetic
tape device.  DSNARL will then print out the number of tracks on
the selected device and then prompt for a density setting.  The
density should be a decimal number which is a legal setting for
the device.  When the program is ready, it will type the prompt
character ">".  In this example and in the ones that follow,
user input is underlined.
.ByHand;

.Group;
Example:  .~~R DSNARL~

          DSNARL (V1.0) here at 9:08 16 MAR 79
          SYSTEM C30-P033/Q
          DEVICE  >>~~FTA1~
          TRACKS:  9
          DENSITY (800,1600)  >>~~1600~

.EndHand;
.Apart;
.Sec Command formats, comformats:
	In the command descriptions in this document, the following
conventions will be observed.  Upper case letters will
denote commands and key words that should be typed exactly as
they appear.  Lower case phrases denote variable information.  Quantities
enclosed by "<#>" must be supplied, while quantities enclosed in
brackets "[#]" are optional.  Choices will appear as a column
or will be described separately in the text.
	Input to DSNARL follows these rules:
.List(-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
The command prompt for DSNARL is ">".  When additional sub-commands
(interactions) are necessary, DSNARL will use the prompt ">>"
whenever it is requesting input.
.Item;
Keyword input is converted to upper case
before processing by DSNARL.
.Item;
Keywords may be abbreviated to the least number of characters
which assures uniqueness.
.Item;
A command may be continued on the next line if the character "&" is
inserted in the current line just before the carriage return.  The
problem this creates for the user is that only the current line
may be edited.  In order to cancel an entire multiple line command
in case of an error, the user must abort it (see {SecRef useraborts}).
.Item;
Leading white space (tabs and spaces) at the beginning of a
command and trailing white space on all lines of a command will be
purged by the input scanner.
.Item;
Usernames which are entered in a command must be enclosed in parentheses
"(#)" in order to be recognized.
.Item;
PPN numbers which are entered in a command must be enclosed in brackets
"[#]" in order to be recognized.
.EndList;
.Ss The tape dump mode
	The dump command causes the user to enter this mode in
which tapes can be examined at the word or byte level in terms
of physical tape blocks and the logical records composing them.
.ByHand;

.Group;

************************************************************************
.EndHand;
.Apart;
	This "dump tape" mode will behave differently depending upon
the type of terminal being used.  After the user types "dump", DSNARL
will ask the following question:
.ByHand;
	Terminal type?  >>
.EndHand;
	The legal responses are (others may be added):
.ByHand;
.Group;
	TTY	Use for hardcopy only or dumb CRT terminals.
	HP	HP-2621 (Tymshare-444)
.EndHand;
.Apart;
.Sss Display oriented terminal operation
	Display oriented operation of the dump function is an
exception to the input rules in that user input will not be prompted
by the usual ">>".  In addition, echo will be turned off so that the
brief commands will not be displayed on the screen; only the results
will be shown.
	On the HP terminal, some extra
keystrokes are required to tell DSNARL when to find the position of
the cursor, since the use of the cursor control keys send no such
indication to the host.  Scrolling of tape data is done by the host
using the editing features of the terminal, since there is no way
to "lock" a portion of the screen and not enough storage in the
terminal to write all the information required at some
steps.  Therefore this will be slower than the local scrolling
operation.
	The first event that happens after selection of display
oriented operation is the appearance of a set of switches and
settings which will be displayed continuously.  Then the user will
be asked to enter a physical tape block number.  The following is
an explanation of the switch settings and their values.
.Crown(0,5,0);
	~~indices~##These are the word number positions which are
indicated on the displays of portions of the tape block being
examined.  The possible values are OCTAL or DECIMAL.
	~~map~##This indicates whether the map feature is enabled
or not.  If enabled, a map of distinguishable logical record types
is produced when the user selects a block to examine.  These types
are denoted by a three-letter code, the same ones which appear in
the SNARL External Specifications document in the Appendix on the
SNARL tape format.  An unrecognized area is denoted by "XXX".  The
legal values for the map switch are ON or OFF.
	~~selected#mode~##This is the translation mode selected by
the user for display of actual tape data.  This switch may have one
of the following values:
.Crown(5,10,0);
	~~OCTAL~##Display 36-bit words in octal.
	~~DECIMAL~##Display 36-bit words in decimal.
	~~SIXBIT~##Display bytes as SIXBIT characters.  Words are
treated as six bytes of six bits each.  The contents of eight
words will be displayed on each line.  On the HP terminal, special
characters will be shown using the "display functions" option.
	~~ASCII~##Display bytes as ASCII characters.  Words are
treated as five bytes of seven bits each with the 35-bit unused.  The
contents of ten words will be shown on each line.  On the HP terminal,
special characters will be shown using the "display functions"
option.
	~~<tape record code>~##Any of the tape record codes
listed in the Appendix on the SNARL tape format in the SNARL
External Specifications is legal here.  Each of these
represents a display format that DSNARL knows for the meaningful
representation of the record.  See {AppRef recdisplay}
for detailed information about these formats, some of which
will be combinations.
	~~DEFAULT~##This switch value causes DSNARL to make
its own decision about display format.  If given a recognizable
record to display, DSNARL will use thresponding format for
that record type.  If given an unknown quantity, DSNARL will
use octal format.
.EndCrown;
.EndCrown;
	In answer to the question about tape block number, the
user may enter either:
.ByHand;

.Group;
     an integer		where 0 is the first block number; or
     LAST		to indicate the last block; or
     NEXT		for next in sequence; or
     PREVIOUS		for previous block.
.EndHand;
.Apart;
{FigQ Frecordmap,12,recordmap,Screen display after new block read}
	{FigRef Frecordmap} is a picture of the screen
after the
user has given a tape block number if the map is enabled.  Hereafter,
the dump function will be in one of four phases, SWITCH, HELP,
MAP, or DISPLAY.
	In SWITCH phase, the settings of the three switches described
above may be changed.
	In MAP phase, the user may move the cursor through the record
map and select a record to display by "marking" the map entry with
a cursor command.  Display can also be requested from anywhere with
an explicit command.
	In DISPLAY phase, the user can scroll through a quantity of
data displayed on the screen and examine individual locations in
various modes.
{FigQ Fdatadisplay,27,datadisplay,Screen picture -  display phase}
	{FigRef Fdatadisplay} is an example of the screen during
display phase.  Notice the "->" at the end of the last line of the
data.  This indicates that there is more data which could not fit
on the screen.  The user may scroll up to view it.
	The following is a summary of the commands.  They are mostly
one and two-character commands.  No carriage-returns are necessary.  The
cursor is moved to the desired places using the cursor control keys
on the keyboard.

************************************************************************
.EndHand;
.Apart;
The QCHECK command performs a quick check of a SNARL tape, mainly looking
at the sequence of SNARL logical records (see description of tape format
in the SNARL external specifications) to determine whether they make
sense.  DSNARL will report such problems as values which are probably out
of range and logical records not in the proper order.  If a record header
word fails to index to the next record header word, then DSNARL will
stop the check at that point with appropriate warnings and information.
.Sss VERIFY;
.ByHand;

.Group;
************************************************************************

*	VERIFY [user list]					       *
*								       *
************************************************************************
.EndHand;
.Apart;
	The VERIFY command is used to check correctness of a SNARL
tape.  It will compare the file contents of tape files against the
corresponding ones on disk as well as performing the same kinds of
consistency checks done by QCHECK.
	If no user list is supplied, VERIFY will compare the user
contents of tape files against files on disk belonging to the same
user name as the tape file.
	The user list may consist of one of the following:
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
A single user name.  This tells DSNARL to compare all tape files
against the files in the single user directory named.
.Item;
A list of user name pairs, separated by commas.  Each pair has the
format:
.ByHand;
	(username_on_disk)_(username_on-tape)
.EndHand;
.Continue;
where username1 corresponds to a disk user name, and username2
corresponds to a tape username.  VERIFY will compare files in
username2 on the tape to the corresponding files in username1 on
disk.  Users not mentioned in the list will be compared as in
the default case (no translation).
.EndList;

*								       *
************************************************************************
.EndHand;
.Apart;
	The DIFFERENCES command is used to compare two files or the set
of files in a directory with the set of files in another directory.  It
is intended as a means to check files which have been stored to a SNARL
tape and retrieved to assure that the retrieved files match the original
ones.  The lookup blocks as well as the file contents are compared.
	The filenames may be specified with or without a username and
should not contain wild card characters.  If usernames only are given,
then the processing goes as follows.  Each file in "username1" is
considered.  If there is a file in "username2" with the same name as
the current one being considered from "username1", then the two are
compared; otherwise a short message is printed.
	The comparisons are done as simple binary compares.  Since this
feature is intended as a screening check, a full report of differences
is not given.  When 20 differences have been reported during a
comparison, then the remainder of the files are not checked and
processing continues with the next files, if any.

.Sec Continuation tapes;
	The QCHECK and VERIFY commands must deal with SNARL tapes
that have been continued on additional reels.  Indeed they should
check the continuation tape for consistency with the previous
tape.
	When the logical end of tape is reached during either of these
commands, DSNARL will print a message indicating that we are at the
end of the current reel.  Then DSNARL will ask the user to enter a
continuation command.  The legal responses at that point are:
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
"?" or "HELP" to get a list of options;
.Item;
"STOP" to terminate the current operation at the end of the last
complete file stored; or
.Item;
"CONTINUE" to continue the DSNARL interaction and prepare for
mounting the continuation tape.
.EndList;
	If the command entered is "CONTINUE", then DSNARL will unload
the current tape, notifying the user, and request that the next one
be mounted.  The user will be prompted for another command.  One
of the following may be entered:
.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
A "GO" command that has the simple format:
.ByHand;
	GO
.EndHand;
.Continue;
This tells DSNARL that the next tape is mounted on the current drive
and is ready to go.
.Item;
A magnetic tape drive name and optionally a density to change the
current drive.  The format of this command is:
.ByHand;
	<tape device name> [density value]
.EndHand;
.Continue;
If this response is used, then DSNARL will continue to prompt for
commands until it gets a "GO".

.Sec Command files, cfiles:
	Command files may be used interchangeably with input from the
TTY.  A command file may contain part of a command (such as a
<file list>) or a whole command or multiple commands.  Command
files may be nested.
	Command files are called at any point with the character "@"
immediately followed by the command file name.  This construct must
be distinguishable from any other input which may be on the
line.  A command file name is expressed in the form
.ByHand;
     [user designator] <file name>
.EndHand;
.Continue;
where the user designator may be a username or a PPN.  There
should be no spaces between the user designator if it exists
and the file name.
	Following a command file call, new input will be read from the
indicated file and echoed to the TTY until the end of the file
is reached or another command file is called.  Since DSNARL will
ignore any line numbers that it finds in the input, command files
may be created with any of the editors on the TYMCOM-X.
	The following rules and restrictions apply to the use of
command files.
.List(-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
Confirmation and interaction will always be done to/from the TTY.
.Item;
When an error or a user abort occurs
during processing of commands in a command file,
SNARL will terminate the processing of that command file and any
others higher in the chain if calls were nested.
.Item;
Nesting is limited to a depth of 10 command files.
.EndList;
.Sec User aborts, useraborts:
	DSNARL will trap on escapes (in XEXEC mode) or CTRL-C
(in PDP-10 mode)
and return the user to command level.  A limited subset of DSNARL
commands, prompted with the special character "!", will be
available at interrupt time if a command execution
was in progress.  They are:
.ByHand;

     HELP       help with available commands
     ?          list of available commands
     ABORT      stop the current operation
     CONTINUE   continue with the current operation
.EndHand;

	The ABORT command will have different effects depending upon
the command which was in process at the time of the abort.  The
general rules are:

.List (-4,4,0,"a)");
.Item;
REWIND and UNLOAD can not be interrupted.
.Item;
Those commands which move tape will report the position when the tape
is stopped.
.Item;
Execution of a non-tape command will terminate, and the state of
DSNARL will be restored to what it was prior to the
command.  However, it will probably not be possible
in practice to abort any non-tape command.
.Item;
If an interrupt and subsequent abort occurs
while at command level or before command execution has been started,
then the command buffers are cleared, and the user is returned to
the normal command level.  The user will be advised of the action
taken.
.Item;
If a command file was being processed, DSNARL will bail out of all
opened command files.
.EndList;
