	~~Phase_I/Preliminary_internal_test_version~:  This is a limited
version of SNARL which would provide enough features for personal use
as an archiving tool but not enough capability as an operations
tool.  However, it would be worthwhile to get a small number of people
using the product at this point in order to get bugs out and collect
feedback on its performance.  As more features are added during Phase II,
the test version which is being used could be updated.
	~~Phase_II/Field_test_version~:  This version will have enough
capability so that operations could use it on a test basis.  It would
probably be run in parallel with TITO for daily backups on a lightly
loaded system.  File recoveries could be accomplished with SNARL with
TITO available in emergencies.  As more features are added during Phase
III, the version which is in field test could be updated.
	~~Phase_III/Full_production_version~:  Upon completion of
acceptance testing by operations, this version will be generally
adopted.
	~~Phase_IV/Futures~:  A set of enhancements could be done, as
documented in the "SNARL External Specifications" which could make this
product much more powerful.

.DSNEXTS: LISTS!
Complete first pass on DSNARL external design.  In this document,
the descriptions of the tape examination features should be
quite complete; some of the others may be much less detailed at this
point.  The document will be ready to distribute for comments (at
least among PDP10/SPP group).

.TABGEN:  LISTS!
Recode and debug TABGEN using the parser described for SNARL.  This
step has carryover into step {LISTS! FRONT} since there is a set of
standard routines which will be common to both.  Some of the program
specific routines will be similar.

.Item;
.FRONT: LISTS!
Implementation will proceed on SNARL with the front-end command
parser.  The entire grammar and command files will be implemented
along with intermediate routines which will "parameterize" the
information in the parse tree.  Instead of calling the command
handlers, the intermediate routines will report their information
for the purpose of testing.  (Later on, the actual calls can be
added.)

Implement and debug QUIT, the mode setting commands, ?, REWIND,

used for tape during initial debugging.

.STORE: LISTS!
Implement WHERE, STORE, and NEW TAPE commands.  This
step will include commands and handling for
user aborts but not for continuation tapes (which will be treated
as an error abort at this time).

.SHAKEDOWN:  LISTS!
Test the current product in preparation for release for limited internal
use.  Update the external documentation, and prepare a memo defining the
usable portions.  At this point, a release could me made for limited
internal use.  Since the continuation features would not be usable,
this version could not be used by operations unless a responsible
person would be willing to do some individual testing and provide
feedback.

~~SLIPPAGES~
.End;
	The delay between items {LISTS! DSNINTS} and {LISTS! DEBSTORE}
was due to firefighting on TAPELIB aggravated by network
flakiness.  Also, several months was spent on TAPELIB to improve its
general reliability and resistance to network problems.
	Slippage on {LISTS! DEBRETRIEVE} occurred as a result of
encounters with tricky or undocumented tape device characteristics
which were time consuming both to discover and deal with.
	~~Potential_schedule_disturbances_to_be_dealt_with~:  The
amount of management time I amding must be watched closely.  The
project management time for SNARL will increase predictably as soon as
SNARL is in internal test.  A project management class (1 week) is a
strong possibility for 1Q81.
