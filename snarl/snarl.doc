     1    Introduction          

     SNARL, which stands for Store Now And Retrieve Later, is a program on
     the TYMCOM-X that is designed to be used for backup storage and
     retrieval of disk files to and from magnetic tape.  It is primarily
     intended to be used by Tymshare operators as a replacement for the
     existing TITO program, to perform the daily system backups and less
     frequent total system saves.  It will, however, handle small transfers
     as well.  SNARL is also useful for moving large quantities of files from
     one system to another.

     The main considerations in the design of SNARL were the following:

         a)  Maximize the speed of large scale file transfers, such as the
             daily backups.

         b)  Maintain adequate error tracking such that large scale transfers
             may easily be restarted.

         c)  Make it possible for an operator to read tapes that have bad
             portions and discover how much and what has been lost.

     NOTE:  Related information about the TYMCOM-X system may be found in the
     TYMCOM-X XEXEC Reference Manual and the TYMCOM-X System Calls Reference
     Manual (YAMM).  For documentation about the TITO program, see the TITO
     User's Guide.

     From the EXEC level, type "R SNARL" to execute the program.  SNARL will
     print a short heading which includes its version number, the time and
     date, the system number, and the Monitor version number.  It will then
     ask for the name of the tape device to be used, and print a ">>" prompt
     for a reply.  Respond by typing the name of any magnetic tape device,
     followed by a carriage return.  SNARL will print the number of tracks on
     the selected device and then prompt for a density setting.  The density
     should be a decimal number that is a legal setting for the device.  When
     SNARL is ready to accept a command, it will print the prompt character
     ">".  In this example and the ones that follow, user input is underlined
     (if the device on which the document is printed supports underlining).
     A carriage return is assumed at the end of the input.

     Example:  -R SNARL                 

               >   (SNARL is now ready to accept commands)

     The operation of some of the commands is affected by user licenses.
     Certain commands require specific licenses.  These conditions are noted
     within the individual command descriptions.  The minimum license is GD.

     Many of the commands depend upon having a SNARL-format tape mounted.  If
     the program believes that it is trying to read a non-SNARL tape, it will
     print one of the following messages:

             This is not a SNARL tape!

             This is not a SNARL tape -- probably a TITO tape.

     3    SNARL Commands           



     3.1    Command Overview             

     This section briefly summarizes the SNARL commands.

     SNARL will perform file transfers between disk and tape according to
     operating modes that can be set by the user.  Mode switch setting is
     performed by the following commands:

        MODE            Print or print and set switch values
        OLD             Print or set OLD switch
        SYS             Print or set SYS switch
        RPRINT          Print or set RPRINT switch
        SPRINT          Print or set SPRINT switch
        REELSET         Print or set REELSET switch
        DSKREP          Print or set DSKREP switch
        TTYREP          Print or set TTYREP switch

     Before a tape can be written on by SNARL, it must be initialized with
     one of the following commands:

        NEW TAPE        Initialize to store at the beginning of the tape
        APPEND          Initialize to store at the logical end of the tape

     The commands that request the actual file transfers are:

        STORE           Stores files from disk to tape
        RETRIEVE        Restores files to disk from tape
        GET             Restores files to the directory of the SNARL user

     Information about a tape can be gotten with one of the following
     commands:

        DIRECTORY       Reads a SNARL tape and prints its directory
        WHERE           Prints last tape position scanned

     Other tape-related commands are:

        CUT AFTER       Make the logical end of tape after a specified file
        REWIND          Rewind with or without wait
        UNLOAD          Unload tape with or without wait
        DEVICE          Open a new tape device
        TID             Change the TID of the current tape

     These commands provide help and program information:

        HELP            Briefly describes all commands or a specified command
        ?               Like HELP, only briefer
        INSTRUCTIONS    Gets a copy of this document
        GRIPE           Allows the user to enter a gripe
        NEWS            Prints the latest information about SNARL


                                      3



     Other, miscellaneous commands are:

        TRANSLATE       Translates user names for RETRIEVE
        UNTRANSLATE     Cancels the translation table
        COF             Changes output destination for next command
        LOG             Sets up a transcript file for user interaction
        UNLOG           Cancels use of the transcript file
        COMMENT         A "do nothing" command to insert comments in the log
        STOP            Stops the current operation cleanly
        ABORT           Aborts the current operation
        QUIT            Exits SNARL



     3.2    Command Formats             

     In the command descriptions in this document, the following conventions
     are observed.  Uppercase letters denote words that should be typed
     exactly as they appear.  Lowercase phrases denote variable information.
     Quantities enclosed in brackets "[ ]" are optional.  Choices appear as a
     column or are described separately in the text.

     Input to SNARL follows these rules:

         a)  The command prompt for SNARL is ">".  When additional
             subcommands (interactions) are necessary, SNARL will use the
             prompt ">>".  input.

         b)  Command and keyword input is converted to uppercase before
             processing by SNARL.

         c)  Keywords may be abbreviated to the least number of characters
             which assures uniqueness.

         d)  A command may be continued on the next line if the character "&"
             is inserted in the current line just before the carriage return.
             The problem this creates for the user is that only the current
             line may be edited.  To cancel an entire multiple line command
             in case of an error, the user must abort it (see Section 6.1).

         e)  Leading tabs and spaces at the beginning of a command and
             trailing tabs and spaces on all lines of a command will be
             ignored.

         f)  User names entered in a command must be enclosed in parentheses
             "( )" in order to be recognized.

         g)  Project-programmer numbers (PPNs) entered in a command must be
             enclosed in brackets "[ ]" in order to be recognized.

         h)  Times and dates entered into SNARL and reported by SNARL are
             considered to be in the user's time zone, although the internal
             storage (on tape) of times and dates will be in GMT.

     *                                                                      *
     *       MODE [ALTER]                                                   *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The MODE command allows the user to print the values of all the user-
     settable switches or examine and modify them interactively.  The
     simplest form of the command, "MODE", causes the current switch settings
     to be printed at the user's terminal.

     Example:  >MODE                
               STORE switches:
                 SPRINT:   USERS
                 REELSET:  1
               RETRIEVE switches:
                 OLD:      NEWEST
                 SYS:      CONFIRM
                 RPRINT:   FILES
               report sizes:
                 DSKREP:   WIDE
                 TTYREP:   NARROW

     The use of the ALTER option allows the user to change any of the values
     interactively.  SNARL prints each value and asks for a replacement.  A
     carriage return causes the old value to be retained.

                 REELSET:  1
               RETRIEVE switches:
                 OLD:      CONFIRM
                 SYS:      CONFIRM
                 RPRINT:   USERS
               report sizes:
                 DSKREP:   WIDE
                 TTYREP:   WIDE

     A more detailed explanation of the switches, their functions, and the
     possible values for each follows.

     SPRINT   This switch controls the amount of statistics reporting done by
              SNARL during a STORE.  Values are:

              TOTALS   Means print only the grand totals for the operation,
                       that is, the total number of files copied.

              USERS    Instructs SNARL to print the total number of files for
                       each user name along with the grand totals.  This is
                       the default.

              FILES    Indicates printing of each file name as it is copied
                       as well as user name totals and grand totals.

     REELSET  This switch controls the numbering of new reels of tape during
              a storage operation.  The legal values for this switch are
              positive integers.  There is no reason to change the default
              value of this switch (=1) except when using more than one tape
              drive (and multiple copies of SNARL) to speed up a storage
              operation.  (NOTE:  Multiple copy feature not planned for
              initial release.) Reels are given numbers of the form "m-n"
              (read "m dash n") where "m" is the value of the REELSET switch
              and "n" is assigned by SNARL, starting with 1.  The maximum
              value of each is the largest integer that can be contained in a

     OLD      When a file in any user name except (SYS) is found on both tape
              and disk during a RETRIEVE operation (that is, this is an OLD
              file), a decision must be made as to which one to put on the
              disk.  The possible values for this switch dictate the
              decision.

              NEWEST   Indicates that the most recent file should be used, as
                       determined by the creation date.

              DISK     Indicates that the disk version of the file should
                       always be used.  (Also DISC)

              TAPE     Tells SNARL to use the tape version of the file in all
                       cases.

              CONFIRM  Tells SNARL to ask for confirmation before writing
                       over a disk file.  This is the default.

     SYS      This switch works exactly like OLD for the files in user name
              (SYS).  Since (SYS) files are usually critical to the operation
              of the system, they have their own switch for protection.  The
              switch values and default value are the same as for OLD.

     RPRINT   This switch controls the statistics reporting done during a
              RETRIEVE.  The legal values and default value are the same as
              for SPRINT except that they apply to the transfer from tape to
              disk.

     DSKREP   This switch controls the size of reports that are sent to disk
              files.  The possible values are:

              WIDE     Report is the size of wide line printer paper (about
                       120 columns).  This is the default for DSKREP.

              NARROW   Report will fit on 8 1/2 x 11 paper.

     TTYREP   This switch controls the size of reports that are sent to the
              user's console or line printer.  The values are the same as for
              DSKREP, and the default is NARROW.

     Each switch that can be viewed or modified using MODE can be more
     quickly manipulated with its own command.  These commands all have the
     following format:

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       switch command [new switch value]                              *
     *                                                                      *

                                      7



     For viewing the current value, the command word alone is used; for
     changing the value, the command word and the new switch value must both
     be supplied.  Naturally, the command words are:

             DSKREP          SPRINT
             OLD             SYS
             REELSET         TTYREP
             RPRINT

     and the switch values supplied with the command must be legal for the
     given switch.

     This command initializes the tape for writing at the beginning of the
     tape with file position 1.

     The TID of the tape (its library control number) is optional.  It can be
     used to verify that a tape being used is the one desired.  The
     performance of the NEW TAPE command depends upon the type of the tape
     that has been mounted and the TID parameter (or lack of it), as the
     following table illustrates.

     The TID of the tape (its library control number) is optional.  It can be

     3.5    File Transfer Commands              

     The file transfer commands (STORE, RETRIEVE, GET) and the DIRECTORY
     command share a similar command structure.  Here is a "picture" of the
     command structure:

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       command word [modifiers] file list                             *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     For each of the file transfer commands and the DIRECTORY command, the
     file list parameter may consist of one of the following entities:

         a)  The keyword "ALL".  This causes all files on disk to be saved
             (STOREd) or all files on the given set of tapes to be retrieved.
             If a STORE command, files will be dumped according to alphabetic
             order of user names.

         b)  A list of ranges of one or more octal global account numbers
             (GANs) preceded by the string "gan=", such as "gan=1-3,6,7-11"
             (to denote GANs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and 11) or "gan=20-E" (20



                                     10



             through the end).  All files in the designated GANs on the
             source device will be copied to the destination.

         c)  A user and file list.  Each list item is a user designator
             optionally followed by a set of file names.  A user designator
             may be either a user name or a PPN.  For example:

                  [1,4],[11447,157776]SNARL.SAI,SNARL.SAV
                  (OPER), (GADOL)SNARL.SAV, (SGAVETTE)

             If no files are specified for a user, all the files for that
             user are transferred.  Therefore, the first example above would
             transfer all files found for the user whose PPN is [1,4] and the
             files SNARL.SAI and SNARL.SAV for the user whose PPN is
             [11447,157776].  File names may contain the standard wild card
             characters "*" and "#", which cause the usual pattern matching.

             In the RETRIEVE command only, a user designator may consist of a
             pair such as "(BAKER)_(ABLE)", which causes files belonging to
             user (ABLE) on tape to be restored to user (BAKER) on disk.
             Also, a file name pair, such as "SNARL.OLD_SNARL.SAI", may be
             used in place of a single file name to change the name of the
             file restored to disk from the name it carries on the tape (in
             this case SNARL.SAI on tape becomes SNARL.OLD on disk).

         d)  A tape file position list.  This type of list is not valid for
             STORE but is acceptable as part of the other file transfer
             commands.  It consists of a list of ranges of one or more
             decimal file positions preceded by the string "pos=", such as
             "pos=1-7,20-30,99-E".

     The file list is delimited by a space or tab.  Extra spaces may appear
     within the list, however, where they make sense.  There are no fixed
     limits on the length of the file list except for the limit on the amount
     of run-time storage that can be allocated to hold the information.

     The following modifiers are valid for the file transfer commands.

     AFTER   This modifier must be followed by a date code expressed as HH:MM
             DD MON YR, where HH:MM is the time in hours and minutes, and DD
             MON YR is the day, month, and year.  Files to be accessed are
             restricted to those created after the specified time and date.
             The time and date may be abbreviated.  If only HH:MM is given,
             the day, month, and year default to the current ones.  If only
             HH:MM DD is given, then the month and year default to the
             current ones.  If only HH:MM DD MON is given, the year defaults
             to the current one.

     BEFORE  This modifier must be followed by a date code as described for
             AFTER.  Files to be accessed are restricted to those created
             before the specified time and date.

     For each of the file transfer commands, the following modifiers are
     valid when the "file list" is the keyword "ALL".


                                     11



     STARTING WITH  This modifier must be followed by a user name and
                    optionally a file name; it instructs SNARL to start the
                    transfer with the specified user or user and file.

     ENDING WITH    This modifier must be followed by a user name and
                    optionally a file name; it instructs SNARL to terminate
                    the transfer at the end of the specified user or file.

     Other modifiers which are specific to individual commands are found in
     the the sections pertaining to the operation of those commands.


     3.5.1    STORE Command               

     The STORE command is used to copy files from disk to tape.  The command
     structure is as described at the beginning of Section 3.5.

     In addition to the modifiers already described, the following are valid
     for the STORE command:

     TWICE        The entire file transfer operation will be performed twice.

     CHANGED      This causes files to be stored which do not have the "file
                  dumped" bit on in the UFD.  Files that are accessed due to
                  this modifier will have their "file dumped" bits set as
                  they are stored.  Therefore the command "STORE CHANGED ALL"
                  causes all files to be stored which have changed or have
                  been created since the last such command was carried out
                  (changes to a file clear the "file dumped" bit).

     INCREMENTAL  This modifier works the same as the CHANGED modifier with
                  the exception that the "file dumped" bits are not set for
                  the affected files.

     TODAY        This causes tape files to be assigned "today's" date (the
                  day the program is run) rather than the date on the disk
                  file.

     The rules for the use of the STORE command are:

         a)  Either the modifier CHANGED or the modifier INCREMENTAL may be
             used but not both.

         b)  The file list may contain duplicate references to files, and the
             affected files are stored as many times as they are referenced.

         c)  If the STARTING WITH modifier is used with a specific file name
             rather than a user name only, the files that will be STORED from
             the given directory are the named file and all others whose
             names are accessed from the directory after the named file.
             This calls for a bit of caution since the directory is not
             considered to be in any particular order.




                                     12



         d)  The SNARL user must have OP license in order to use the
             modifiers ALL or CHANGED with the STORE command.

         e)  For integrity, files being accessed by SNARL will be locked
             (exclusively entered) while they are being dumped to tape.
             SNARL will report files on its log which it cannot open because
             they were already entered, so that users can be notified if it
             is necessary for them to make a special arrangement for that
             file.  Previous versions of this document indicated that such
             files were to be copied to scratch files, and the scratch files
             would be stored to tape.  I am convinced that this is a very bad
             idea.

         f)  Temporary files will be ignored during a STORE.  These are
             defined as files that have the temporary bit turned on in the
             .RBLIC word of their lookup block.

     Examples:  STORE ALL
                STORE CHANGED STARTING WITH (OPER) ALL
                STORE AFTER 10:00 19 MAR 79 (GADOL)
                STORE BEFORE 12:30 19 (GADOL)
                STORE AFTER 7:45 (GADOL)
                STORE INC ALL
                STORE TODAY TWICE (GADOL)*.PUB


     3.5.2    RETRIEVE Command               

     The RETRIEVE command is used to move files from tape to disk.  The
     command structure is as described at the beginning of Section 3.5.

     In addition to the modifiers already described, the following is valid
     for the RETRIEVE command:

     SETDUMPED  This causes the "dumped bit" to be set in the lookup blocks
                of all files restored to disk from tape during the RETRIEVE.
                It should only be used during a system rebuild in order that
                the next backup not contain all the files on disk.

     The rules for the use of the RETRIEVE command are:

         a)  Files are moved according to the file list in the order in which
             they appear on the tape.

         b)  Duplicate file references in the file list will not cause the
             affected files to be accessed more than once.

         c)  RETRIEVE may be affected by the presence of entries in a
             translate table (see Section 3.9.1).

         d)  The SNARL user must have OP and RF license to RETRIEVE a tape
             created using the STORE command with the ALL modifier or to
             perform user name translations.  During other retrievals,



                                     13



             license should apply to tape file access in the same way that it
             applies to disk file access.  If files are to be put into
             directories other than the SNARL user's, WF license is needed.

         e)  The tape is rewound before the command is executed.

         f)  If retrieving a tape file that has the same name as a disk file,
             the tape file will be restored to disk in supersede mode (see
             TYMCOM-X System Calls Reference Manual) unless storage on the
             affected directory is inadequate.  If storage is a problem, the
             file will be restored to a scratch file in a separate directory
             and then renamed by SNARL to the correct place.  The SNARL user
             will be notified that this is happening so that he or she can
             abort and skip the affected directory if problems persist.

     Examples:  RETRIEVE (ADELE)_(GADOL)*.*
                RETRIEVE ALL STA (ABLE) END (BAKER)


     3.5.3    GET Command               

     The GET command functions the same as the RETRIEVE command except that
     it puts restored files into the SNARL user's file area.  Read files
     license is required to GET files of users in GANs other than the SNARL
     user's GAN.


     3.5.4    Handling of Sparse Files                 

     SNARL will make use of the page mapping features of the paging monitor
     to read and write files.  When storing a file on the tape, a marker will
     be put on the tape (EMP) to indicate a "hole" in the file as indicated
     by a page mapping call.  When restoring files from tape, the markers
     will be used to create a file on disk with the same "holes".


     3.5.5    System Rebuilds               

     A new procedure is suggested for full system rebuilds to conquer the
     problem of deleted files reappearing.  This is often the case when
     starting the rebuild with the last "all files".  Instead, the retrieval
     should be started with the latest incremental backup and working back to
     the "all files".  For the successive retrievals the DISK option to the
     OLD and SYS switches should be used so that only the files which have
     not already been retrieved will be read from the tape.  This method
     should also speed up disk recovery.


     3.5.6    Transfer of File Licenses                 

     The transfer of file license will proceed according to the following
     rules:




                                     14



         a)  Files are stored on tape with complete information about the
             license that was assigned to the disk file.

         b)  Licenses up to those that the operator has set will be restored
             to the disk file during a RETRIEVE command as long as the disk
             and tape user names and PPNs are the same.

         c)  Licenses other than XC or HF will not be restored to the disk
             file during a GET or RETRIEVE if the disk and tape user names
             don't match; instead SNARL will report the licenses it could not
             restore.

         d)  All license restoration problems will be reported to the SNARL
             operator as well as to a file in a coded format.  (See Section
             7.2.9 and Appendix E.)

     This scheme is much more restrictive than the one earlier proposed
     (which involved unconditional restoration of licenses as long as tape
     and disk user names matched).  It seemed preferable to restrict
     licensing in favor of a reporting scheme that could be extended at a
     later date to notify users and assist them with restoring licensing.



     3.6    Tape Information Commands              


     3.6.1    DIRECTORY Command               

     The DIRECTORY command prints a listing of file names and positions on
     the tape.

     The structure of the DIRECTORY command is the same as that described for
     the file transfer commands.  Additional modifiers which are valid for
     this command only are:

     CHECKSUM  This modifier tells SNARL to compute the checksums of the
               files it reports.  The algorithm used is the same as that
               employed in the CKSUM program.

     LIMITED   A limited directory listing using only the resident directory
               at the front of the tape is produced.  (See Appendix C.)

     The program proceeds for a normal directory (i.e., not LIMITED) in
     similar fashion to a RETRIEVE but lists each file name and position
     (INDEX) instead of transferring the files.  The tape is rewound before
     the command is executed.

     The directory listing contains a header indicating the TID, reel number,
     when it was first created, the system and monitor numbers, the version
     number of SNARL that wrote the tape, tape drive characteristics, and the
     time zone in which times will be reported.  The tape list follows with
     columns headed INDEX, FILE NAME, USER NAME, CREATION DATE, DATE WRITTEN,



                                     15



     SIZE, WORD COUNT, and CHECKSUM (if requested).  The format is as follows
     when the WIDE report format is used:

     COLUMNS      CONTENTS

       0-5        File position number (INDEX) in decimal
       8-13       File name                  } These file specifications
         14       "."                        } come from the original
      15-17       File extension             } disk file from which the
      20-31       User name                  } tape file was written.
      33-37       Creation time (user's time zone)
      39-47       Creation date (user's time zone)
      49-53       Time file written to tape (user's time zone)
      55-63       Date file written to tape (user's time zone)
      65-69       Allocated size of file in pages
      71-79       Word count of the file
      81-86       Checksum (if requested)

     Column headings are repeated for each user, and the PPN and totals for
     each user are printed following the list of corresponding files.  On a
     NARROW listing, the time and date that the files were written to tape
     appear under the creation date for each file.

     A LIMITED directory will report only the contents of columns 0-31, since
     only the resident tape directory is used for the report.


     3.6.2    WHERE Command               

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       WHERE                                                          *

     ************************************************************************

     The WHERE command causes SNARL to print on the user's terminal the last
     tape position scanned.

     Example:  >WHERE                
               The last complete file read from tape was
               (GADOL)SNARL.SAV at file position 78.

                                     16



     The CUT AFTER command allows the user to redefine the logical EOT (end
     of tape).

     The parameter is an integer describing the file position on the tape.  A
     tape directory lists these numbers.  It is the responsibilty of the user
     to determine the exact place that the tape should be "cut" by doing a
     directory or reading the file onto disk and checking it.  The file whose
     position is given will become the last file on the tape when the CUT is
     complete.


     3.7.2    REWIND Command               

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       REWIND [WAIT]                                                  *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The REWIND command rewinds the tape and normally returns control to the
     user immediately without waiting for completion.  If the WAIT option is
     included, REWIND will wait for completion before giving control to the
     user.

     A REWIND command issued after a STORE command "de-initializes" the tape.
     It will be necessary to give an APPEND or NEW TAPE command before
     storing anything else on the tape.


     3.7.3    UNLOAD Command               

     *       UNLOAD [WAIT]                                                  *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The UNLOAD unloads the tape and normally returns control to the user
     immediately without waiting for completion.  If the WAIT option is
     included, UNLOAD will wait for completion before giving control to the
     user.


     3.7.4    DEVICE Command               

     *       DEVICE [device name [density]]                                 *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The DEVICE command can be used to read the characteristics of the
     current tape device or to change tape drives or the density setting of



                                     17



     the drive.  Since device changes are dangerous, the previous values of
     the device name and density settings will be reinstated and the user
     notified unless this command is followed immediately by either a NEW
     TAPE command or an APPEND command.

     The simplest form of the command, "DEVICE", causes SNARL to print the
     characteristics of the current device.

     The user may not change the density unless the device is reassigned to a
     different drive.  If the user supplies a density and device name, the
     new device is initialized with the specified density setting.

     If a device name only is given, SNARL will print the known
     characteristics of the device and prompt the user for the density
     setting.

     Example:  >DEVICE                
               FTA0  800 BPI  7 TRACK

     Example:  >DEV FTA2                 

     *       TID [tid number]                                               *

     ************************************************************************

     The TID command allows the user to read or change the TID stored on the
     current SNARL tape.

     The simplest form of the command, "TID", causes SNARL to print the
     current TID value.  If a TID number is supplied, that value will be
     stored on the tape as the new TID after an appropriate dialog takes
     place.  If "DELETE" is used, the TID value on the tape will be deleted
     after an appropriate dialog takes place.

     The type of dialog that takes place depends upon the tape that has been
     mounted and the parameter to the TID command.

     3.9.1    TRANSLATE Command               

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       TRANSLATE [user name substitution list]                        *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The TRANSLATE command is used to set up or add to a translation table
     for tape and disk user names.  The table is used only when performing a
     RETRIEVE request.


                                     20



     The optional user name substitution list is a list of items separated by
     commas, where each item is of the form (username1)_(username2).
     Translation is from username2 to username1.

     The word TRANSLATE by itself causes the contents of the current table to
     be displayed.

     These rules govern the use of translation tables:

         a)  The translation table is used only when performing a RETRIEVE
             request.  The RETRIEVE will copy all the files indicated by its
             parameters, translating user names as indicated in the translate
             table.  A user name substitution implied in a parameter to the
             RETRIEVE command overrides a translation table entry with the
             same tape user name.

         b)  The TRANSLATE command does not clear any table entries that may
             already exist; it adds to an existing table.

         c)  The translation table is in effect until cleared by an
             UNTRANSLATE command.

         d)  There will be no fixed limits on the length of translation
             tables except the limits on the amount of run-time storage that
             can be allocated to hold the necessary information.

     Example:  TRANSLATE (ABLE)_(BAKER),(ABLE)_(CHARLIE)
               RETRIEVE ALL

     This example indicates that during a RETRIEVE, files of user names BAKER
     and CHARLIE will be restored to user ABLE on disk.  All other files will
     be retrieved from tape and restored on disk with no user name
     translation.

     ************************************************************************

     Output from the DIRECTORY, STORE, RETRIEVE, and GET commands is normally
     sent to the user's terminal.  The output may be directed to a disk file
     instead of or as well as to the terminal or line printer by the COF
     (Change Output File) command.

     The keywords TERMINAL, TELETYPE, and TTY stand for the terminal.  LPT
     stands for the line printer.

     The COF command with no parameters causes the current output
     destinations to be listed.  The output file name may include a user name
     or PPN.

     The output file and/or device remain the same until another COF command
     resets them.  The COF command clears the current values before setting
     up new ones.

     4    Continuation Tapes           

     When the files requested in a STORE command will not fit on one tape,
     SNARL will generate continuation tapes.  Each continuation tape will be
     assigned a new reel number.

     When the logical end of tape is reached, SNARL will print a message
     indicating the last file stored on the current reel.  Then SNARL will
     ask the user to enter a continuation command.  The legal responses at
     that point are:

         a)  "?" or "HELP" to get a list of options;

         b)  "STOP" to terminate the current operation at the end of the last
             complete file stored; or

         c)  "CONTINUE" to continue the SNARL interaction and prepare for
             mounting the continuation tape.

     If the command entered is "CONTINUE", SNARL will unload the current
     tape, notifying the user, and request that the next one be mounted.  The
     user will be prompted for another command.  One of the following may be
     entered:

         a)  A "GO" command, which has this format:

                     GO [[TID] tape control number]

             This tells SNARL that the next tape is mounted on the current
             drive and is ready to go.  The dialog that follows depends upon
             the type of tape mounted and the value, or lack of it, that is
             entered as a tape control number.  It is similar to what is done
             when a NEW TAPE command is processed.

         b)  A magnetic tape drive name and optionally a density to change
             the current drive.  The format of this command is:

                     tape device name [density value]

             If this response is used, SNARL will continue to prompt for
             commands until it gets a "GO".















                                     24



     Example:  FTA2  6250 BPI  9 TRACK
               Tape #1-1 ends with file (GADOL)SNARL.SAI.

               Please enter a continuation command.  >>CONT                                                       
               Unloading the tape on FTA2.
               Please mount next tape and GO when ready.

               >>FTA3                 
               FTA3  6250 BPI  9 TRACK

               >>GO TID 1032                   
               Initializing with TID 1032 assigned.  OK to continue?  >>Y                                                                        

               Tape #1-2 created at 19:30 on 31 MAR 79 with TID 1032
               continues with file (GADOL)SNARL.REL.

     When restoring from tape to disk, SNARL will ask the user to mount
     continuation tapes as needed.  The dialog is similar with the exception
     of the TID interaction, which is not needed.  The program will check
     some of the tape header information and the file position numbers on the
     continuation tape for consistency to make sure that it has the right
     tape.

     Changing the tape characteristics when starting a continuation tape is
     something that should be done with caution and only when necessary.  The
     operator should take care to label the stored tapes accordingly so that
     the same sequence may be used for a retrieval.  For ease of recovery of
     a large storage operation, this practice is NOT advised.

     The continuation tape feature is intended for use by operations for the
     daily backups.

     NOTE:  Some re-design is needed on this feature.  The assumption has     
     been that SNARL would not break files across tapes.  This must be done
     to accomodate the giant files which can be generated (particularly by
     MIS).

     5    Command Files           

     Command files may be used interchangeably with input from the terminal.
     A command file may contain part of a command (such as a file list), a
     whole command, or multiple commands.  Command files may be nested.

     Command files are called at any point with the character "@" immediately
     followed by the command file name.  This construct must be
     distinguishable from any other input that may be on the line.  A command
     file name is expressed in the form

          [user designator]file name

     where the user designator may be a user name or a PPN.  There should be
     no spaces between the user designator and the file name.

     Following a command file call, new input will be read from the indicated
     file and echoed to the terminal until the end of the file is reached or
     another command file is called.  Since SNARL will ignore any line
     numbers that it finds in the input, command files may be created with
     any of the editors on the TYMCOM-X.

     The following rules and restrictions apply to the use of command files:

         a)  Since the commands DEVICE and NEW TAPE tend to be variable,
             especially among different systems, and should always be used
             with caution, they will not be permitted within command files.

         b)  Confirmation and interaction will always be done to/from the
             terminal.

         c)  When an error or a user abort occurs during processing of
             commands in a command file, SNARL will terminate the processing
             of that command file and any others higher in the chain if calls
             were nested.

         d)  Nesting is limited to a depth of ten command files.

     6.1    User Aborts             

     SNARL will trap on escapes (in XEXEC mode) or CTRL-C (in PDP-10 mode)
     and return the user to command level.  A limited subset of SNARL
     commands, prompted with the special character "!", will be available at
     interrupt time if a command execution was in progress.  They are:

        SPRINT     Change printing options for STORE
        RPRINT     Change printing options for RETRIEVE, GET
        WHERE      Progress information about current data transfer
        HELP       Help with available commands
        ?          List of available commands
        STOP       Stop the current operation cleanly
        ABORT      Abort the current operation
        CONTINUE   Continue with the current operation

     The STOP and ABORT commands will have different effects depending upon
     the operation that was in progress at the time of the abort.  In most
     cases, STOP and ABORT will cause the same behavior.  The general rules
     are:

         a)  REWIND and UNLOAD can not be interrupted.

         b)  Those commands that move tape will report the position when the
             tape is stopped (equivalent of the WHERE command).

         c)  The STORE command will respond to a STOP by ending the tape as
             if everything had terminated normally after the last complete
             file stored (i.e., a "CUT AFTER" is done before returning to the
             normal command level).  An ABORT will cause STORE to return to
             normal command level immediately without properly ending the
             tape.  The user will be warned when this happens and may always
             do a "CUT AFTER" if the current tape data is to be used.

         d)  The RETRIEVE and GET commands will terminate immediately,
             leaving no partially retrieved files on the disk.

         e)  Execution of a non-tape command will terminate, and the state of
             SNARL will be restored to what it was prior to the command.
             However, it will probably not be possible in practice to abort
             any non-tape command.

         f)  If an interrupt and subsequent abort occur while at command
             level or before command execution has been started, then the
             command buffers are cleared, and the user is returned to the
             normal command level.  The user will be advised of the action
             taken.

         g)  If a command file was being processed, SNARL will bail out of
             all opened command files.

     6.2    Bad Tape Recovery              

     A maintenance program (DSNARL) will be developed, one of whose functions
     will be to recover (as much as possible) and copy bad tapes.

     7    Future Commands and Features             

     This section is a discussion of some commands and features that will be
     implemented in a later version.  The descriptions here may lack some of
     the detail elsewhere in this document.



     7.1    Commands            


     7.1.1    BACKUP Command               

     This command would be used to do the daily system backups.  It would
     rely upon a stored schedule of the operations to be done each day, which
     might encompass a week's or month's worth of archiving.  The operator
     would need only give this command, and the appropriate command for that
     day would be executed.  OP license would be required.


     7.1.2    SCHEDULE Command               

     SCHEDULE is the complement to BACKUP.  It would allow viewing or
     changing the stored system backup schedule.  Manager license would be
     needed to change the schedule.


     7.1.3    ARCHIVE Command               

     ************************************************************************
     *                                                                      *
     *       ARCHIVE archive file name [CHECKSUM]                           *
     *                                                                      *
     ************************************************************************

     The ARCHIVE command causes SNARL to create an archive disk file from a
     SNARL format tape.  The format is such that a data base could be loaded
     from the contents of this file.

     ARCHIVE will create an archive only of the whole tape and will
     optionally compute checksums of the files on tape.  Headings (as in the
     DIRECTORY format) are not written; the format of each record in the file
     is:













                                     29



     COLUMNS      CONTENTS

       0-5        File position number (INDEX) in decimal
       8-13       File name
         14       "."
      15-17       File extension
      20-31       User name
      33-37       Creation time (GMT)
      39-47       Creation date (GMT)
      49-53       Time file written to tape (GMT)
      55-63       Date file written to tape (GMT)
      65-69       Allocated size of file in pages
      71-79       Word count of the file
      81-95       PPN
      97-101      Reel number
     103-109      TID number
     111-116      Checksum (if requested)



     7.2    Features            


     7.2.1    Archives for Daily Backups                 

     It would be helpful for operations to have a data base or data bases
     that catalog the files stored on the current month's worth of daily
     backup tapes.  It would be reasonable to build an archive file (with the
     same format as would be produced by the ARCHIVE command) automatically
     while the STORE operation is in progress.  Then the results could be
     loaded into a data base upon completion.

     To have something truly useful, some additional data base programming
     would be necessary to make it easier for the operators to ask frequently
     used questions, such as "Where is the most recent copy of file x?".


     7.2.2    Restarting a STORE with CHANGED Modifier                   

     Building the archive file during STORE processing saves the information
     that is needed if it is necessary to restart a STORE that employed the
     "CHANGED" modifier.  Presently in TITO, the information as to which
     files have been dumped if such an operation is aborted is lost.  If the
     operator wishes to restart, he or she must use the "CREATED AFTER"
     modifier to be sure to pick up all the files that have changed, probably
     requesting more files than necessary.


     7.2.3    Using Multiple Copies of SNARL                  

     It will be possible to use multiple tape drives with multiple copies of
     SNARL to speed up a file transfer (in particular, a complete system dump
     or reload).  The STARTING WITH and ENDING WITH modifiers to the file
     transfer commands and the REELSET mode switch enable this possibility.


                                     30



     7.2.3.1    During a STORE                  

     The operator must start each transfer at the beginning of a user name.
     A feature could be added to SNARL which would calculate the appropriate
     breakpoints based upon the sizes of the various user directories and the
     number of tape drives and copies of SNARL that could be run.  It is also
     necessary to get unique reel numbers assigned when multiple program
     copies are run.  The REELSET switch can be used to create unique reel
     numbers for tapes mounted on secondary drives.  In addition, a MULTIPLE
     switch for the STORE command could be used to tell SNARL to mark the
     last tape in the set as if it were to be continued.  This will allow the
     retrieval process to be smooth if only one copy of SNARL is used for the
     retrieval or a directory.


     7.2.3.2    During a RETRIEVE                  

     If restoring a tape set created with multiple drives, it will be easiest
     to use the same configuration used during the storage operation.


     7.2.4    Recovering Bad Tapes                

     Among the features of a companion maintenance program for SNARL should
     be a means of recovering tapes.  This should include such functions as
     recreating the resident tape directory or tape header and recovering as
     much information as possible from tapes with bad portions.  The format
     of SNARL tapes is designed with these objectives in mind.  SNARL itself
     should report discrepancies when it finds them.


     7.2.5    Sort Options on Files                 

     Adding an option to sort files according to criteria such as creation
     time or alphabetic ordering of names is a possibility for consideration.


     7.2.6    Dummy User Names on Tape                  

     Allowing the user to translate user names during a STORE to a dummy user
     name on tape is another option to consider.  Such a feature would make
     it easy for the user to catalog or classify sets of files for quick
     retrieval.  For security purposes, it would probably be necessary to
     retain on tape the information concerning the original disk user name.

     Another possibility might be the creation of subcategories of a user's
     files.  Relationships could be established with other users' files by
     means of creating subcategories with the same name for files in several
     directories.

     7.2.7    Tape Descriptions               

     Allowing the "labeling" of tapes with a description of variable length
     might be helpful.


     7.2.8    EXPERT Mode               

     Shorter messages and perhaps less interaction in some cases should be
     helpful to expert SNARL users.  The normal mode is what this document
     describes.


     7.2.9    License Restoration Problems                

     Perhaps these could be reported to the individual account by a program
     that reads the file of license problems.

     To assist users in restoring license, a program like SETLIC could be set
     up to handle a list of file licensing commands that could be produced
     for individual users from the log of licensing problems.  Or perhaps a
     command file that would be used to run SETLIC could be produced from
     that log or during the SNARL data transfer.


     7.2.10    Storing Temporary Files                 

     An option to STORE might be necessary to allow storing temporary files.


     7.2.11    DIRECTORY Command Extension                 

     It might be helpful to have the DIRECTORY command work consistently with
     the file transfer commands.  An additional modifier would cause SNARL to
     report the list of files that would be stored if the DIRECTORY command
     word were replaced with STORE.  An analogous modifier could cause a
     similar report from the tape, indicating the files that would be
     retrieved if the DIRECTORY command word were replaced by RETRIEVE.  Of
     course, the applicable file list parameters, including the full RETRIEVE
     set, would need to be accepted as part of the command.  A modifier to
     the STORE and RETRIEVE commands that would cause the file list from the
     most recent DIRECTORY command to be used could be added.

     Another method of implementing this might be the addition of a TEST
     command.  The command would consist of the word TEST followed by a
     complete STORE or RETRIEVE command.  The result of the TEST would be a
     file list.  Another command, such as EXECUTE could be used to carry out
     the STORE or RETRIEVE command included within the TEST.

                           Major Differences from TITO                              




     Many of the TITO commands have been retained in SNARL.  The major
     changes are as follows:

         a)  The concept of a "saveset" is not retained in SNARL.

         b)  SNARL will not retain backward compatibility with older tape
             formats such as TITO, TEX, or FAILSAFE.

         c)  The following commands have changed or are no longer needed in
             SNARL.

                 MODE - operation of command has changed
                 SKIP - not needed
                 SKIP WRITE E - not needed, an APPEND should be done instead
                 FAILON - not needed
                 FAILOFF - not needed
                 PREALLOCATE - not needed, monitor does not support
                               preallocation
                 NOPREALLOCATE - not needed
                 FLAGOFF - incorporated in the data transfer commands
                 NOFLAGOFF - incorporated in the data transfer commands
                 UPDATE - not needed, file mode decision made by SNARL
                 NOUPDATE - not needed, file mode decision made by SNARL

         d)  The following commands are new:

                                SNARL Tape Format                                  




     The tapes are oriented toward 36-bit words and are written using DEC
     compatible 7 and 9-track modes.  A tape is written as a single file
     composed of fixed-length large physical records each of which contains a
     set of logical records of various types.  The first word of each of
     these records is a descriptor with a half-word integer identifier in the
     left half and the count of the total number of words in the logical
     record in the right half.  This scheme should make tape searching fairly
     easy and allow for expandability of the types.  The various data records
     and their definitions are as follows:

     A TAPE HEADER will be found at the beginning of each tape.  It will
     occupy a large physical block (the same size as all the others) with the
     unused portion of the block marked with a DUMMY record.

              word 1:  the word SNARL in ASCII
              word 2:  SNARL version numbers
              word 3:  tape format number (to allow for changes)
           words 4-5:  TID (in ASCII)
              word 6:  reel number (low order half > 1 if continuation)
              word 7:  time tape was created (GMT) in seconds since midnight
              word 8:  date tape was created (GMT) in DEC format
              word 9:  non-zero if a system backup tape; 0 otherwise

     record containing tape directory information.

              word 3:  user PPN of first file in record


     LOOKUP records contain the information from the extended lookup of each
     file to be dumped.

     An END OF TAPE marker indicates the logical end of the data on a tape or
     set of tapes.

     Having a limited tape directory resident on the SNARL tape allows for
     quicker scanning to determine what may be on a tape and faster access
     for individual files.

     The first two words of each directory record on a SNARL tape are the
     directory header words as described in Appendix B.  The actual
     directory, which follows the directory header words, is composed of
     eight-word entries with the following format.

             word 0:  position number
             word 1:  physical record number
             word 2:  word index
             word 3:  PPN
          words 4-5:  user name (SIXBIT)
          words 6-7:  file name (SIXBIT)

     The following bits in the .RBSTS word will be used or set by SNARL.

     14 - set (on UFD LOOKUP only) by SNARL if it finds a bad file in the
          corresponding directory while restoring files from tape.  The
          monitor will report files flagged as bad to the user when he or she
          logs in.

     21 - read by SNARL and used during STORE commands when the file list is
          the keyword "ALL".  If this bit is set, SNARL will not dump the
          corresponding file.  If this bit is set in the lookup block of a
          UFD, SNARL will not dump any files in the corresponding user's
          directory.  The program DMPUFD may be used to set or clear the bit
          in the lookup block of one's own UFD.  This bit is currently used
          in the same way by TITO.

     32 - set by SNARL if it finds the file bad while restoring from tape.

     The following bits in the .RBLIC word will be used or set by SNARL.

      4 - This is the "file dumped" bit.  It is set by SNARL on all files
          dumped during processing of the command "STORE ALL CHANGED" (with
          or without other modifiers).  These bits are normally cleared when
          a file is changed or created.

      8 - This is the temporary file bit.  It is also bit 23 of the status
          word returned by the .CHUFD UUO.

     The following is obsolete.  If files are reported rather than copied
     when busy, bit 9 is not needed.

      9 - This bit is used during a STORE when the file list is the keyword
          "ALL".  If the bit is on, SNARL will not copy the corresponding
          file for the purpose of dumping it to tape if the file is busy
          (entered).  This use of such a bit was requested by the MAGNUM
          group to insure the integrity of files that are dumped and could be
          used by other subsystems as well.

     The license problems file is used to report all problems with
     restoration of license during a RETRIEVE.  It is stored in the SNARL
     operator's directory as LICENS.XXX, where XXX is a three-digit number
     between 000 and 999.  The name is reported by SNARL when it starts the
     RETRIEVE.

     The file consists of six-word entries, each of which looks like the
     following:

              word 0:  PPN
           words 1-2:  user name (SIXBIT)
              word 3:  file name (SIXBIT)
              word 4:  file extension (SIXBIT)
              word 5:  total file license bits (same as in lookup block)
