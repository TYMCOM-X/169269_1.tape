.Item;
SAIL uses channels 1 through 4 to simulate overflow interrupts and
ILL MEM REFS.  They should not be employed by a user program.
.Item;
If interrupt handling is being done without other process handling, then
the "Require processes" statement is needed to insure that the necessary
run-times are loaded.

.Item;
For buffered I/O, non-standard buffer sizes are not to be used when the
device is a disk.  The buffers are normally specified in the OPEN
subroutine call.
