                                SUMMARY                                



     This quarter reflects the time which finally had to be spent on the
tape library software to clean  up the TRP numbering problem,  which has
been anticipated  and put off  for a long  time.  The installation  of a
testing system in order  to check the solution should  help considerably
to debug fixes in the future  and should allow me to reduce the  work on
this system to  a background task while  not dropping it  completely.  A
few more  fixes are planned  along with some  data base  maintenance and
auditing tools.




                                 DETAIL                                 



SNARL/WHERE,NEW_TAPE,STORE:    These  commands   were  coded   with  the
     exception of continuation tape  handling which will be  done later.
     They are ready for a debugging pass.

DSNARL/skeleton_with_TTY_dump_commands:   For   this  project,   it  was
     necessary to get the  DSNARL grammar specified and to  put together
     the main program and  the complete parser.  The  following commands
     were implemented:   ?, REWIND, UNLOAD,  QUIT, INDICES,  BLOCK, MAP,
     and T.  They are ready for a debugging pass.

TAPELIB/testing_system:   A  completely  separate  tape  library  system
     running from username (ADELE) was put in place.  All the  10's that
     I can get at have satellites.  940 satellites are on systems  2, 8,
     and 14, and  370 satellites are  on 41, 46,  47, and 48.   The same
     370's  which  have  satellites  can  also  be  updated.    The  940
     satellites, called 1tapelib,  and the programs UPDATE,  TAPTAP, and
     TAPSLV are set up  with compilation switches to allow  selection of
     test or production  version.  A COM  command file is  on (ADELE:36)
     for the purpose  of copying the files  from the official  system to
     the test system for debugging.

TAPELIB/bug_fixing_project:  The main reason for tackling tapelib was to
     correct  a boundary  problem  which will  cause the  system  to get
     tangled  when  the  highest  numbered position  in  a  set  of rack
     positions (rack numbers  in a center  with the same  prefix letter)
     reaches 10000.  Valley Forge  is getting close to this  limit.  The
     software to fix this problem is being tested on the tapelib testing
     system and should be installed on the real system early in  2Q.  In
     addition, the long existing inconsistencies in the storage of TID's
     on the  370's and  a working  HISTORY command  are also  in testing
     stage.  These fixes  should be installed  for general use  early in
     2Q.  The 370 data bases must be refreshed with TID's reformatted at
     the same time.



                                   2



     There are a few other problems I would like to continue working on.
     One is the bug in ACCEPT  and TAPELIB on the 370's which  can allow
     garbled information to get  through and later appear in  the UPDATE
     transactions, causing backlogs.  I am at a disadvantage in  the 370
     environment through lack of experience.

TAPELIB/maintenance_and_"fires":   The  amount  of  time  spent  on this
     category  is  roughly  double  the  "normal"  rate  that  has  been
     experienced  during  the  previous  several  quarters.   There  are
     several major reasons for  this.  One of them concerns  some public
     relations  work involved  with finding  the reason  that  FOCUS was
     removed from V43 and getting the problem solved.  It was ultimately
     re-installed, allowing me to re-install TAPELIB on V43 (updating to
     43 had to be disabled while FOCUS was unavailable).

     Another concerns TYMNET.  Network problems not only  contributed to
     backlogs of UPDATE transactions for the 370's but also  made fixing
     the  problems difficult  and  time-consuming.  During  the  week of
     March  3, a  backlog developed.   It was  during this  time  that I
     discovered  that (PJ)  was starting  the UPDATE  program  only once
     every  two hours.   I  had not  been notified  of  this intentional
     change to (PJ) and had  to make calls to the appropriate  people in
     order to get the situation changed.  UPDATE is now being started on
     a 15-minute schedule.  Furthermore, network flakiness  impacted the
     operators doing data  entry to the  tape library resulting  in more
     phone calls which I had to handle.

     In addition, I was  attempting some training sessions  for Faramarz
     in  conjunction with  the firefighting.   This slowed  the progress
     somewhat.

TAPELIB/other:  This was mainly the preparation for and the  training of
     Faramarz  on  the tape  library  software.  The  goal  was  to have
     Faramarz take over the day-to-day chores and perhaps  contribute to
     the set of programs used to maintain the system.  The training time
     and other guidance was spent,  but the goal was not reached  due to
     his leaving the company.

other_"fires"_and_maintenance:  This concerns a TITO fire  researched in
     conjunction with two members of the MAGNUM group.

FORMAT_program:  I  spent some  time converting  this program  for cross
     referencing  sources  to  Tymcom-X.   Mike   Hinckley  subsequently
     completed some bug fixing to make the program usable.

-/miscellaneous:   This  time  includes  interviews,  moving,  and  some
     general organizational tasks taken on during network down time.
