Subject: COEES Sail problem

    Carl, Jon, whomever:

    A fellow calling himself INSD.J/O'CONNELL ((201)981-2879) called
    me from Newark New Jersey or some such place complaining that
    COEES is having trouble recompiling their SAIL INIT programs on
    :29, even though said programs reportedly compile fine on :36.  A
    clue is that they use (FTSYS)SAIL.  My guess is they include some
    horrible module which on :29 was not compiled under the same
    version of the SAIL compiler as the one on :36.

    I looked at the version of SAIL on both systems, and find no
    discrepencies.  Since it's not my job to handle this kind of
    stuff, I'll let you deal with it further.

I really can't do much unless I know what usernames and what files
are being re-compiled on either system 36 or 29.  Please contact
Angela or J/O'Connell and obtain more information.  Ken's primary
diagnosis is probably correct, but without further information....

Except for a brief trip to the office, I plan on working from home on
the COEES TRU interrupt code.  If you need me for anything, call me
at 415-961-1082.  I am working at home in order to decrease the number
of interruptions so that I can finish the TRU stuff by tomorrow, and
make sure it is properly tested.  /Carl

Subject: COEES TRU interrupt

At this point, there should be no problems in making the delivery schedule
of an operating system with a TRU interrupt installed.  The code has been
written and installed to set the limit and trap the interrupt.  This is
what "I" promised to have completed by the middle of July.

There is one complication!

COEES will still need a routine which sets the limit and takes the trap
from within a FORTRAN (F40) program.  Trivil task, except that the runtimes
already use the interrupt system, and I cannot give COEES a routine which
usurps the interrupt vector in use by the runtimes just to setup (add) one
interrupt cause for exceeding the TRU limit.  Again, trivial to change,
EXCEPT that sources (or even proper .REL files) containing the current
interrupt code are UNAVAILABLE or NON-EXISTENT.

Please locate the sources, or contact Tim Brengle about locating what
sources are available.  Until then, I can do no more.

Well, it's been done since sunday night... the monitor anyway....

I'm still looking for the sources to TRULIM, 'cause it seems that I
may not be able to do much without them.  reconstruction may be able
to be done, but to what ramifications, I'm not sure.  I'll know in
2 days whether there are any sources anywhere...

In the meantime, if you could contact Tim Brengle, ask if he knows of
any, or who might have them...  Also, find out what his relationship
to Tymshare is concerning F40 (is he a possible consultant? or was that
just rumor? if either, are we [you and craig] going to continue the
arrangement?).  [I have no opinion on this matter.]

Thanks.  Call or leave mail. I'll be in and out, I'm trying to locate
people in software distribution to have them restore various f40/lib40
transmittals dating back to 1975 to see if we can find anything! Sigh!

Subject: TRU interrupt status

Craig,
  As I mentioned on Monday, the monitor with the TRU interrupt is UP
and running on system 26.  In talking with Angela, she caught some flak
about the version change P034/L21 to P034/N04 but I told her to explain
that /N04 is equivalent to /L35 (14 source changes).  COEES still wanted
to have had a new TRULIM routine by yesterday as well.  Sigh!

  Anyway, I told Angela to explain that that is a change to LIB40 and to
isolate possible problems, that COEES was getting things in stages, i.e. it
would be a couple of days before I could tell her WHEN I'd have the next
version ready (with the new TRULIM routine).

  Since I spent all day and most of each night Friday thru Sunday getting
all of this ready (including searching for TRULIM sources) I did not get
some errands which I MUST get done, done over the weekend.  As such, I
will be working on the TRULIM / F40 stuff from home for the next couple
of days.  If you or Jon need me for anything, please send mail or call me
at home (415) 961-1082.

PS. If you are sure about the RFP's and the positions being available,
    I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know when you'd be available to
talk to Cheryl.  We'll be out running some errands this morning, but
some MAIL, or I can have her call you sometime today would be fine.  How
do I call your Fremont number form a "real" telephone?

I found them, or some facsimile... will tell you all later after I've

Subject: TRULIM changes, LIB40 release

I've made the changes necessary for the TRULIM routine to work with
the new monitor.  As soon as I can re-construct a LIB40 transmittal,
I'll call Angela and tell her that it's ready.  As it stands, I may
have to back out one set of changes that Tim started to make to the
current sources (FORSE doesn't assemble), however, the archived copies
of FORSE.MAC exist and should be no problem.  I'm still working from
home, so feel free to call me, or leave mail.

Jon,  about the associate programmer, or tech-writer positions, let me
know when you'll have time to talk to Cheryl.  I'm trying to balance
her schedule between you and Dave Miller/Ron Saltgaver.  Thanks again!

Craig, Jon,
  All that's left is for me to finish digging through the last couple
of LIB40 transmittals to get a "good" copy of FORSE with which to make
the changes.  Tim left the current sources in a non-working state.  I'll
let you know as soon as I'm ready to give COEES a special LIB40.  Any
actual LIB40 transmittal is going to require a lot more work, and another
body.  /Carl

See next message for details....

  I got your msg while in the meeting, and finally got to your mail
much later after the meeting finished.  There wasn't anything *new*
to tell about the status until about 15 minutes ago.  I just hadn't
any luck in finding the missing transmittal sources.

Subject: TRULIM/FORSE sources to match (SYS:26)LIB40.REL

Well,
  After a week of scrounging, with little or no "luck", I found a
source file which generated a binary .REL file the same size as the
one included in LIB40.REL on system 26.  In a stroke of luck, it was
found that although it didn't match, the only difference was the
version number in module FORSE.  I changed the version, re-assembled
it, and VOILA!!!!  FORSE.MAC which generates the proper .REL file!

  A similar comparison shows that no changes were made to TRAPS.REL
(which contains TRULIM) and the ancient source that I found is still
valid.

  One last note:  System 26 has a different LIB40 than that of most
                  of the rest of the world, so I still need to perform
                  a cursory set of tests on system 26 before we give
		  it to COEES for testing.

  Delay!  System 26 has been down from 11pm til 5am for the past two
          days, so the testing will have to wait until this afternoon.


PS:  Jon, feel free to contact Angela and tell her she will have a new
     FTLIB40.REL for COEES to test by tomorrow (Thursday) morning at
     the very latest.  If all goes well in my testing, sooner. I will
     try to call her sometime Wednesday afternoon.

If it pases their tests, I will have to build them a separate version
to use on their production systems.

Subject: TRU limit code've just completed my testing and installed the new LIB40 on system 26
for COEES to test.  I've sent mail to Angela (rather than a phone call
since it is well after 6pm east-coast time) on system 26 relating the
current status.

Notes on general release of the TRU interrupt code for the rest of the
world....

  1.  F40 - LIB40 on other systems than 26 still need to track down
            proper source files via "trial and error" before a general
            release can be properly made.
  2. P034/P will be the first general release of the monitor to support
            the TRU interrupt, scheduled for October release.
  3. YAMM - Documentation release, also due in October will include TRU
            limit and interrupt descriptions as well as any other changes
            made for P034/P.

	I just talked with some one from Operation and Maintenence in Dallas
about the yesterday's problem with D37. They told me that it  was a solid CPU
problem. Since they were going to move the D37 software to a KL this week end,
last night they went ahead and moved D37 to KL,  so as of today D37 is running
on KL health and happy...

Subject: Users using Peak?

    Jon,

    I got a call from a Ron Vivier about his travels in Europe, and
    the demand he ran into from the European affiliates for User
    availibility of Peak on Tymcom-X.  As you know, to date we've had
    an explicit test for the Tymshare Internal Bit in Peak as a means
    of preventing real users from using it.  I told Ron that there is
    no documentation worthy of a general user's consideration, and he
    said that they (the European Operations types making the request)
    were aware of that, but these were no normal users.  In fact, they
    (either the Operations people or the users in question) might very
    well write their own manual for Peak!

    Our options at present are to either continue our past practice of
    adding these users to the execption list, or removing the filter
    altogether, and making it publicly usable.  (In the case of the
    latter, finding out what the "writing their own manual" really
    means would be a good idea.)

    I was wondering about your thoughts on the matter.

    /ken

    PS:  Each path is equally easy to implement.
